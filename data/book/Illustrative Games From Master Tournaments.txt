ILLUSTRATIVE GAMES FROM MASTER TOURNAMENTS



                GAME No. 1

    White: Tartakower.   Black: Burn.

   King's Gambit declined (compare p. 30).

          1. P-K4         P-K4
          2. P-KB4        B-B4
          3. Kt-KB3       P-Q3
          4. PxP

On principle this exchange cannot be commended, as the opening of
the Queen's file increases the Black Queen's mobility.  White
derives no benefit from the KB file so long as the Black Bishop
makes castling impossible. White intends to play P-B3 and P-Q4,
but the manoeuvre is doubtful, and the whole opening includes an
inordinately large number of pawn moves. In the present game
Black exposes the failings inherent to this system unequivocally.

          4. ...          PxP
          5. P-B3         Kt-QB3

Black cannot put off White's P-Q4 by B-KKt5, for White can give a
check with the Queen and unpin the Knight.

          6. P-QKt4

The object of this move is not clear, as P-Kt5 does not win a
pawn (Kt-R4; 8. KtxP; 9. Q-R5ch). It does not promote development
either, and only compromises the QBP and QKtP.

          6. ...            B-Kt3
          7. B-Kt5          Kt-B3

This is aimed at the White King's pawn, which is deprived of its
natural support by the QKt. In this position Black does well to
attack White's KP rather than to defend his own, because an open
King's file can only benefit him. Being able to castle, he can
occupy the file with his Rook before White has time to bring his
King into safety.

          8. KtxP

It would have been better to protect the pawn by Q-K2 or P-Q3.

          8.    ...            Castles!

                Diag.  100

The beginning of a brilliant attack. Whether White exchanges the
Bishop or the Knight, he is overwhelmed.

          9. KtxKt

After 9. BxKt, PxB; 10. KtxP, Q-K1 wins; 10. P-Q4 would also lose
because Black gains two pawns after KtxP; 11. O-O, KtxP. It is
interesting to note how speedily the weakness at White's QB3 is
brought to book.

          9. ...               PxKt
         10. BxP               KtxP!!

Now White can neither take the Kt nor the R. In the first case Q-
R5ch forces mate very soon, in the second B-B7ch, followed by B-
Kt5ch or B-R3ch, wins the Queen.

          11. P-Q4           Q-B3!
          12. BxKt           Q-R5ch
          13. K-Q2           QxB
          14. Q-B3           Q-R5!
          15. P-Kt3

Not QxR, because of Q-B7ch and the loss of the Queen by a
discovered check by the Bishop.

                             Q-Kt4ch
          16. Q-K3           Q-Q4

          18. K-B2           P-QR4

Such is the price to pay for premature advances.

          19. PxP            RxP
          20. B-R3           P-QB4

Black shatters White's pawn position, and his Bishops and Rooks
have full play along open files and diagonals.

          21. PxP            RxB!
          22. KtxR

or PxB, RxRPch; 23. RxR,QxRch; 24. K-Bl,B-B4.

          22. ...            BxP

The rest speaks for itself.

          23. Q-K5           B-B4ch

                  GAME No. 2

       White: Leonhardt. Black: Marshall.

    Falkbeer Counter Gambit (compare p. 35).

          1. P-K4           P-K4
          2. P-KB4          P-Q4
          3. PxQP           P-K5
          4. P-Q3           PxP
          5. QxP            Kt-KB3
          6. Kt-QB3

It would be quite bad to play P-B4 and try to hold the extra pawn
at the expense of development. Black would very soon occupy the
King's file with his Rook and there would be no time for White to
bring his King into safety, e.g. 6. P-B4, B-QB4; 7. Kt-KB3,
Castles; 8. B-K2, R-K1, and already now there are threats of Kt-
K5 or Kt-Kt5 followed by B-B7ch or Kt-B7.

           6. ...           B-QB4
           7. B-Q2

White would of course like to continue with B-K3 in order to make
a fight for the possession of the diagonal. He would, however,
lose his chance of castling through Black's Q-K2. This is
detrimental in all such cases where the lines in the centre are
open or likely to be forced open at any time.

          7. ...            Castles
          8. Castles        QKt-Q2
          9. B-K2           Kt-Kt3
         10. B-B3           B-KKt5
         11. B-K3?

White has not yet completed his development, and his first care
should be to bring out his KKt. This he could have done without
difficulty, thus: 11. BxB, KtxB; 12. Kt-R3.  After the move in
the text, Black not only occupies the King's file but gains a
move in so doing.

         11. ...            BxBch
         12. QxB            R-K1
         13. Q-Q4           Q-Q3

Black's course is obvious; he must win the QP. The forces will
then be equal in material, but there will remain a

flaw in White's position, namely the exposed KBP, and this tells
in the ending.

          14. P-KR3

Now the square at KKt3 is unprotected, and this is serious in
view of a probable Knight's ending, where, moreover, it will
sooner or later be necessary to play P-KKt3 in order to support
the KBP. Both the KKtP and KBP would be weak, with the King on
the other wing, and be under constant threat of being captured.
The game does proceed as indicated, and the simple and logical
manner in which Marshall brings home his advantage in a very
short time shows convincingly how fatal a shattered pawn position
can be for the end-game. Instead of the move in the text, White
should have played BxB followed by Kt-B3, which would have
completed his development without making another pawn move.

          14. ...           BxB
          15. KtxB          QR-Q1

making a loophole for the King. In this case the move is correct,
as the threat of mate ties the Black Rook to his rank. It is
wrong to make a loophole, as weak players are fond of doing, as
early as possible "in case," before it is shown that there will
be a need for it, or that there will be a Rook ending.

          20. P-R3

White is afraid of playing 20. QxP on account of Kt-Kt5, which
threatens KtxBP followed by Q-QB3. 21. QxP would not be a
sufficient defence because of Q-B4 threatening mate, and on the
other hand 21. Q-R4 would conjure up a dangerous attack,
beginning with P-QKt4. When the players castle on different
wings, there is always the danger of the opponent sacrificing
pawns and opening up files for his Rooks and Q against the
castled King. The game then assumes a wild character, and as
matters are generally settled one way or another in the middle-
game, end-game considerations, both with regard to number and
position of pawns, can be disregarded. Experience has shown that
the player who develops his attack first is likely to win, and
that it is of little use to submit tamely to an assault of this
kind without attempting a counter attack.

Such games are very difficult for the beginner to understand.
There is about them something violent and difficult to estimate,
and years of practice are necessary in order to gain the judgment
required for weighing up the possibilities of attack and counter
attack, where the Kings have castled on opposite wings.

          20. ...            P-R3
          21. R-Q1           Kt-B3
          22. QxQ            RxQ
          23. RxR            PxR
          24. Kt-Q4          Kt-K5
          25. Kt-K2          K-B1

The Black King now pushes forward irresistibly, and attacks the
weakened pawns on the King's wing. The White King cannot get any
nearer, as a check by the Black Kt would win a pawn at once. The
end is easy.

          26. P-B3           K-K2
          27. K-B2           K-K3
          28. P-Kt3          Kt-B7
          29. Kt-Q4ch        K-B3
          30. P-KR4          P-KR4

Now the P at Kt3 is "backward" and therefore lost.

                GAME No. 3

     White: Spielmann. Black: Prokes.

      Vienna Game (compare p. 35).

          2. Kt-QB3       Kt-KB3
          3. P-B4         P-Q4
          4. PxKP         KtxP
          5. Q-B3

It is contrary to the principles governing sound play to bring
out the Queen early in the game. The opponent frequently has an
opportunity of gaining a move by driving off the Queen,
developing a minor piece at the same time. In the present case
Black might have gained the advantage in the following way: 5.
... Q Kt-B3. Now if: 6 KtxKt then Kt-Q5!; 7 Q-Q3?, PxKt; 8 QxP?,
B-KB4. If, however, 6 B-Kt5, Black obtains the better game by
playing 6. ... KtxKt; 7 KtPxKt, Q-R5ch; 8 P-Kt3, Q-K5ch; 9 QxQ,
PxQ; 10 BxKtch, PxB, with two Bishops on open diagonals. There is
no harm in the doubled pawn, as White cannot attack it. Black's
immediate threat is B-R3 or KB4, which exerts pressure at Q6, and
White will find it difficult to advance his QP.

          5. ...           P-KB4

This move is open to discussion, as the Kt which it means to
support can be driven away by P-Q3. On the other hand, if White
does play his QP to Q3, Black can prevent its further advance by
P-Q5, after which the White KP is insecure and the KB somewhat
shut in.

          6. P-Q3          KtxKt
          7. PxKt          P-Q5
          8. Q-B2!

White offers his QBP in order to be able to strengthen his centre
by P-Q4, and to free his pieces. To protect his QBP would be
inferior, e.g. 8 Kt-K2, Kt-B3 or 8 B-Kt2?, PxP; 9 BxP, B-Kt5!; 10
BxB, QxR5ch; 11 Q-B2, QxBch; 12 Q-Q2, Q-Q5.

          8. ...           PxP?

It would have been better, of course, to continue developing with
Kt-B3, which at the same time maintains the pressure on Q5.

           9. P-Q4         B-K3
          10. Kt-R3

Intending Kt-B4 with a view to exchanging the Bishop.  After
that, Black's position on White squares is weak specially on the
diagonal QR7, KKt1, which was opened by Black's fifth move, and
on which the White Bishop can soon operate.  The game is
instructive in showing the development of that idea.

          10. ...          B-K2
          11. Kt-B4        Q-Q2
          12. KtxB         QxKt
          13. B-Q3         P-KKt3

Black cannot prevent White's threat of Q-K2 and B-B4.

          15. Castles      QxQPch

Black is obliging. The opening of files in the centre is
favourable for White, as he can make use of his Rooks in the
combined attack. Instead of the move in the text, development
with Kt-B3 and Castles QR was the last, though slender, chance of
saving the game.

           3. B-B4         B-B4
           4. P-B3

The beginning of interesting operations in the centre. The steady
development with: 4. P-Q3, P-Q3; 5. Kt-B3, Kt-B3; 6. B-KKt5, B-K3
or Castles tends to a draw from the very first, and is thought
dull.

           4. ...        Kt-B3

Black can avoid the exchange of pawns, which White tries to bring
about after P-Q4, by playing his Queen to K2.  This covers his KP
a second time, and White's P-Q4 can be answered with B-Kt3.
White's QBP then obstructs the Kt's natural development. In a
game von Schewe-Teichmann  (Berlin, 1907) the position discussed
on p. 117 was reached after the following moves: 5. Castles, P-
Q3; 6. P-Q4, B-Kt3; 7. P-QR4, P-QR3; 8. P-R5, B-R2.

The pawn sacrifice by 7. Kt-B3, KtxKP; 8. Castles! is much more
interesting and more in keeping with the spirit of the opening.

20.  B-R5ch, KtxB; 21. Q-Kt6 with perpetual check); 14. Q-B3,Q-Q2
(BxR; 15. QxPch followed by Q-K6ch and QxB); 15. B-Kt5!, QxB; 16.
QxB, P-KB3; 17. QR-K1, PxKt; 18. RxKtch and mate in a few moves.

b. X v. Y, first 10 moves as before: 11. RxKt, Castles; 12. P-Q6,
PxP 13. B-KKt5, Kt-B4; 14. Q-Q5!, BxB; 15. KtxB, Kt-R3 (QxKt; 16.
QxPch); 16. Q R-K1, resigns.] White obtains a quick development
and prevents Black from freeing his game by playing P-Q4. After
8. ... BxKt; 9. P-Q5 follows (Moller attack), and after 9. ... B-
B3, White wins back his piece by R-K1 (10. PxKt would not be
good, as Black could free his game by KtPxP and P-Q4). On the
other hand, after 8. ... KtxKt; PxKt, White in addition gains a
move, as BxP is countered by Q-Kt3.

As played here, Black succeeds in playing P-Q4, and the game is
even. Indeed the isolated QP is a weakness in the White position.

          7. ...             BxBch
          8. QKtxB           P-Q4!
          9. PxP             KKtxP

         11. Castles KR      Castles
         12. KR-K1           P-QB3

Now the Knight is securely posted in the centre, and Black can
accumulate forces for the attack on the White QP, possibly by Q-
Kt3, R-Q1 and Kt-B4.

         13. P-QR4

in order to drive the Queen from her Kt3, but this advance is
"three-edged," as Master Gregory would say, and the pawn is sure
to prove weak in the end-game.

         13. ...             Q-Kt3
         14. Q-R3            B-K3
         15. P-R5            Q-B2
         16. Kt-K4

Kt-KKt5 would seem to be stronger here. B-B4 would then be
answered by 17. B-Q3. After BxB, 18. QxB, White obtains
opportunities for a King's side attack, in which the Rook could
co-operate via K4 and Kt4 or R4.

         16. ...             QR-Q1
         17. Kt-B5           B-B1
         18. P-KKt3?

This produces weak points at KB3 and KR3, and there being as yet
no definite threat in Black's Kt-B5, should have been avoided. It
is of course difficult to formulate a plan of attack, for there
is no weak place in Black's armour. In any case White could
safely have played QR-Q1 and Q2 in order to double the Rooks on
the King's file or Queen's file according to circumstances. But
now as soon as a Rook moves to Q1--and that will have to be done
in the end, to support the weak QP--Black's B-Kt5 might become
awkward.

          18. ...            Kt-B4
          19. QR-Q1          Kt-Q3!
          20. BxKt           Kt-Kt4

avoiding an isolated pawn in a subtle manner.

Kt-K5 would be answered by KR-Q1; 26. KtxP, KtxP threatening both
Kt-B6ch and Kt-B7. If White stops both threats with Q-B3, Kt-K7ch
wins.

          26. R-K7            Q-Q3

Now Black foregoes his well-earned advantage. He overlooks
White's subtle move 28. P-R6. 26 Q-B1 was indicated.  White's
Queen's Pawn could not escape, and there was time to dislodge the
White Rook from the seventh by R-Q2, e g. 26. ... Q-B1; 27. Q-
Kt3!, QR-Q2; 28. Q-K3, RxR; 29. QxR, KtxP.

The pawn threatens to queen. Taking the Rook's pawn would not be
so good, as it would displace the Knight. White would not only
regain the pawn easily with Kt-K3, but would also get his King
into play.

          34. Kt-K1        R-K1

Here R-QB1 affords winning possibilities for Black.  On account
of the threat of R-B8, the exchange of Knights by White would be
forced, and his game would have been badly cramped by the Black
KBP, e.g. 34. ... R-QB1; 35. KtxKt, PxKt; 36. R-R1 (K-K1?, R-B7;
37. R-Q6, R-K7ch; 38. K-B1, RxP; 39. K-K1, R-K7ch; 40. K-B1, R-
K4), R-Kt1; 37. R-Kt1, R-Kt6. After the move in the text the game
is drawn.

          35. KtxKt          PxKt
          36. R-Q6           R-QB1

There is nothing in this move, as the Black passed pawn is now
attacked.

          4. P-B3          Kt-B3
          5. P-Q3

P-Q4 would seem to be the logical consequence of P-B3, and
therefore preferable. After the text move Black will sooner or
later be able to enforce the advance of his own pawn to Q4, and
his pieces will then have the greater mobility.

          5. ...          P-Q3

Here Black might have played P-Q4 at once. For if White takes the
pawn, he leaves Black in possession of the pawn in the centre. If
he does not do so but plays B-QKt5 instead, Black's reply would
be Q-K2 and the exchange of pawns at K 5 would follow. White's P-
B3 is then clearly a lost move.

There is nothing in the weakness at Black's KB3 and KR3 caused by
the disappearance of his KKt Pawn, as White has lost his KB. On
the contrary the open file should be a distinct asset, for,
having a strong centre, Black's pieces are more mobile and he is
more likely to get an attack.

P-K5 would seem to be better, as it opens a diagonal for the KB,
and a diagonal, too, for the QB, as White has to exchange the
pawns. Indeed Black would soon have obtained a winning advantage,
e.g. 20. ... P-K5; 21. PxP  (Kt-R2, Q-R5; 22. Q-K2, Kt-K4), BPxP;
22. Kt-R2, Q-R5; 23. Q-K2 (P-KKt4 or B-Q1, P-B4), Kt-K4,
threatening Kt-Kt5 and Kt-Q6. As it is, White gains a little
time, although Black's position still remains superior.

          21. Q-K2          Q-K2

intending to play P-B3, thus retarding Black's P-K5, which is
still hanging over White like Damocles' sword. The move, however,
lets in the Knight.

          26. R-R2          P-B4
          27. P-B3          P-K5

Now this move is no longer feasible, as White's brilliant
sacrifice demonstrates. To make the move possible, long
preparations would have been necessary, such as: R-Kt3, B-Q2-B3,
etc.

The scene has changed with startling suddenness. White has open
files and diagonals for all his forces, whilst Black's pieces are
immobilised. Whatever he plays, Black must lose the piece he has
gained.

          9. B-QKt5        BxB

Generally speaking, exchanges such as this are doubtful.
However, in the present case, although it opens the B file for
White, White cannot prevent Black from obtaining the same
advantage.

          10. PxB           P-QR3

Black gives up the move he has gained. There is no justification
for this, as nothing prevents him from proceeding with his
development at once with 10. ... Castles.

          11. BxKtch       PxB
          12. P-QKt4

White is anxious lest his KtP should be made "backward" by P-QR4
and P-B4. This is one of the drawbacks of the premature advance
of the QRP.

This creates a weakness at Q4.

Unimportant as it appears to be, it is the cause of the loss of
the game, as the opposing Knight gets in ultimately. The doubling
of the Rooks on the KB file would seem to be the best plan.

          19. ...           Kt-R4
          20. P-Kt3

White's weaknesses at KB3 and KR3 are more damaging than the
corresponding ones in the Black camp, as Black still possesses a
Bishop of the same colour as the weakened squares.  But the move
is now compulsory; for were White to allow the Black Knight to
his KB5, and to drive him off then with P-Kt3, the Knight could
play to his R6 and prevent the doubling of the White Rooks.

          21. R-B2          Kt-Kt2

White begins to operate in the centre and on the Q wing, as his
position on the K side begins to be doubtful. The intention is to
play P-Q4, which, however, Black opposes at once.

If now White plays P-Q4, he loses a piece by PxP; 24. KtxP?, RxR;
25. KxR, Q-B3ch.

          23. R-K1

The Rook has no future here, and R-Q1, in order to play P-Q4, is
more logical. But as Black obviously threatens to double his
Rooks on the KB file, it would be advisable to play for an
exchange of Rooks, with: Kt-Kt2, QR-B1 and Kt-K1.

Black can avoid the complications of the Max Lange attack by 5.
... P-Q3. In that case White cannot recover the pawn, and in
order to develop his QKt effectively, would have to play P-B3,
aiming at rapid development in return, after 6. ... PxP; 7. KtxP.
But Black can frustrate this plan either by pushing his pawn to
Q6, so that the QKt is barred from the square B3, or by playing
B-KKt5 with this probable continuation: 7. Q-Kt3, BxKt; 8. BxPch,
K-B1; 9. PxB, Kt-B3, and Black has the better game, for White's
King's side is broken up and his pieces undeveloped, while Black
has prospects of attack on the open KB file.

                Diag. 107

This is the typical position in the Max Lange attack.  With his
ninth move White threatened to win a piece by KtxB and Q-R5ch.
Black could not parry the threat by 9. ... Q-Q3, on account of
PxP followed by Kt-K4-B6ch.  The position in the diagram appears
to be favourable for Black, as all his minor pieces are in play,
whilst White's development is somewhat restricted by Black's
strong pawns at QB5 and Q5. For a long time this opening has not
been played in tournaments, being considered unsatisfactory for
White.  With the present game, and his new move of 15. B-R6,
Marshall has reopened the question as to whether White's attack
on the K file plus the pawn at KKt7 is sufficiently tempting.

          10. Kt-QB3           Q-B4
          11. QKt-K4           Castles QR

This is imperative. If Black retires the Bishop from his unsafe
position, White permanently prevents Black from castling, which
is bound to be fatal in view of the open K file--e.g. 11. ... B-
Kt3; 12. PxP, R-KKt1; 13. P-KKt4, Q-Kt3; 14. KtxB, PxKt; l5. B-
Kt5, RxP; 16. Q-B3 with a violent attack.

          12. KtxQB

If White tries to win the exchange in the following way:  12. P-
KKt4, Q-K4!; 13. Kt-KB3, Q-Q4; 14. PxP followed by Kt-B6, Black
can initiate a promising counter attack by 14. ... BxP!!; 15.
PxR-Q, RxQ; 16. Kt-B6, QxKt; 17. QxQ, BxQ. In this case White
exposes his King's side by P-KKt4 in order to benefit from the
unstable position of the Black KB, but unless care is taken, he
can easily fall a victim to an attack on the open KKt file

          12. ...               PxKt
          13. P-KKt4            Q-K4

Not Q-Q4, on account of PxP and Kt-B6.

          14. PxP               KR-Kt1
          15. B-R6

This is Marshall's innovation. It gets the Bishop out of play, as
P-Kt5 must necessarily follow, yet the pawn at Kt7 holds the
Black Rook, and there is a permanent threat of Kt-B6 either
winning the exchange or, if the Knight is taken, giving White a
pair of formidable passed pawns.

          15. ...             P-Q6
          16. P-B3            B-Q3

This is quite to White's liking, since he wishes to advance Ids
centre pawns. Black's only chance of escaping disaster would be:
B-K2, with R-Q2, Kt-Q1-B2. Instead of this, his next few moves do
not reveal any concerted plan, and he loses in a surprisingly
short time.

          17. P-B4          Q-Q4
          18. Q-B3          B-K2
          19. P-Kt5         Q-B4
          20. Kt-Kt3        Q-B2

In manoeuvring his Q, Black has achieved nothing either for
counter attack or defence. Now White has numerous attacking
chances. He first turns his attention to the KP.

          21. Q-Kt4          QR-K1
          22. R-K4!          P-Kt4
          23. P-QR4

and now even the QR takes part in the assault. Black's game is
hopeless.

          23. ...            P-R3
          24. PxP            PxP
          25. K-Kt2

attacking the KP by avoiding the check.

          25. ...            Kt-Q1
          26. Q-B3           Q-Kt3
          27. R-Q4           P-B3
          28. RxKtch         KxR
          29. QxP            Resigns.

After this, no master has tried to defend a "Max Lange" in an
international tournament.


                   GAME NO. 8

     White: Blackburne.    Black: Em. Lasker.

                  Scotch Game.

          1. P-K4           P-K4
          2. Kt-KB3         Kt-QB3
          3. P-Q4           PxP
          4. KtxP           B-B4
          5. B-K3           Q-B3

The threat KtxKt and BxB must be met in some way.  P-Q3 is not
satisfactory, for Black remains with a trebled pawn after the
double exchange. An alternative to the text move is B-Kt3. Q-B3,
however, has the advantage of developing a piece, and although it
is the Queen, White has no early opportunity of driving the same
off, such as he often obtains when the Queen comes out so soon in
the game.

          6. P-QB3          KKt-K2
          7. Kt-B2

In order to develop the QKt.

          7. ...            P-QKt3!

Out of three possible moves, Lasker selects the one which
contributes most to development. B-Kt3 does nothing in that
direction, and BxB would bring the White Knight further into
play. The text move prepares the development of the B at Kt2 with
the option of Castles QR. If White exchanges Bishops he gives up
the command of his Q4.  Black's P-Q3 might have had the same
result, but then the exchange would have given White a majority
of pawns on the K side, whilst White's three Q side pawns would
have held the black Q side pawns, one of the latter being
doubled.

          8. Kt-Q2          Q-Kt3

The exchange of Bishops allows White to play Kt-K3, thus avoiding
the weakening move P-K Kt3. 9. B-KB4 is answered by P-Q4!.

          9. BxB            PxB
         10. Kt-K3          R-QKt1
         11. P-QKt3         Castles
         12. B-B4

To prevent Black's P-B4.

At first sight it seems as if the QBP ought to move to B4, as the
advance of the QKtP has weakened it. But White dares not allow a
Black Knight to settle at Q5.

          12. ...            P-Q3
          13. P-B4!

                Diag. 108

Black threatens to play K-R1 in order to play P-B4.  White's
position would then be very bad, and therefore he rightly decides
to anticipate the move, even at the cost of a pawn. In order to
gain the QBP Black must waste a number of moves with the Q, and
White gains time for a King's side attack. The pawn sacrifice is
very promising indeed.

          13. ...              Q-B3
          14. Castles          QxQBP
          15. R-B3

There seem to be many threats here, and the position is a
difficult one to fathom. After disentangling his Queen, Black
tries very hard to force his P-B4. As soon as he succeeds in this
he has a won game, for the open file is available both for
defence and counter-attack.

          15. ...             Q-Q5
          16. K-R1            B-K3
          17. R-QB1           BxB
          18. RxB             Q-Kt7

Q-B3 is impossible apart from the fact that it would block the
KBP, e.g. 18. ... Q-B3; 19. P-K5, PxP; 20. Kt-K4, etc.

          19. R-QB2          Q-B3

Now the attack shown in the last note could be answered with Q-
R5.

          20. Kt-Kt4

Here P-KKt4 could be answered by Kt-Q5, e.g. 21. P-Kt5, Q-Kt3;
22. R-Kt3, P-B4.

          20. ...           Q-Kt3
          21. R-Kt3         P-B4
          22. Kt-K5         Q-K3
          23. KtxKt         KtxKt
          24. P-K5          Kt-Kt5!

This prevents the Rook from occupying the Q file which is about
to be opened.

          25. R-B4          PxP
          26. Q-R1          Q-Q2!

If now QxP, Black plays R-B2 with unanswerable threats of R-K1 or
Q1.

                    GAME No. 9

            White: Salwe. Black: Marshall.

                Two Knights' Defence

          1. P-K4          P-K4
          2. Kt-KB3        Kt-QB3
          3. B-B4          Kt-B3
          4. Kt-Kt5

This attack may be tempting, as the BP cannot be protected, but
it is against that elementary principle which says that no attack
should be undertaken in the opening until the minor pieces are
mobilised, provided of course that Black also has made sound
opening moves. There is every likelihood that the attack in the
present instance will lead to nothing.  It has taken many years
to find the correct reply, but now that it is known, the opening
has practically disappeared from master practice. Instead of the
move in the text, White can play either P-Q3, leading almost
unavoidably to a drawing variation of the Giuoco piano, or
Castles which might bring about the Max Lange attack after 4. ...
B-B4; 5. P-Q4, PxP.

           4. ...          P-Q4
           5. PxP          Kt-QR4!

This is a typical position in the Two Knights' defence. The
former continuation 5. ... KtxQP has long been abandoned, as the
attack that White can initiate by 6. KtxBP, KxKt; 7. Q-B3ch,
forcing the Black King to K3, is dangerous though the result is
uncertain. The move in the text breaks the attack from the very
first, and Black gets the advantage

as he can gain time by attacking the two minor pieces which it
should be noted, are unsupported, and in addition obtain a speedy
development, worth more than the pawn given up for it.

          6. P-Q3

B-Kt5ch is an alternative. The advantage is Black's in this case
also--e.g. P-B3; 7. PxP, PxP; 8. B-K2, P-KR3; 9. Kt-KB3, P-K5;
10. Kt-K5, Q-B2; 11. P-Q4, B-Q3 (or PxP e.p. followed by B-Q3);
12. P-KB4, PxP e.p.; 13. KtxP, Kt-Kt5 or 11. P-B4, B-Q3; 12. P-
Q4, PxP e.p.; 13 KtxP, Castles. Black has an easy game and open
lines.

           6. ...          P-KR3
           7. Kt-KB3       P-K5
           8. Q-K2         KtxB
           9. PxKt         B-QB4
          10. KKt-Q2

The Knight must move sooner or later.

          10. ...          Castles
          11. Kt-Kt3       B-KKt5
          12. Q-B1

A sorry retreat, but the plausible Q-Q2 would be disastrous, e.g.
P-K6!; 13. PxP, Kt-K5 and Q-R5ch

          12.  ...          B-Kt5ch

Black's superior development begins to tell in no uncertain
fashion. Now White can neither play 13. B-Q2 on account of BxBch;
14. QKtxB, R-K1, followed by P-K6, nor 13. Kt-B3 on account of
BxKt; 14. PXB, P-B3 regaining the pawn and maintaining positional
advantage. White has therefore no alternative but P-B3, which
weakens his Q3, where a Black Knight soon settles down.

           13. P-B3          B-K2
           14. P-KR3         B-R4
           15. P-Kt4         B-Kt3

At last White can castle. He can, of course, only castle on the
Queen's side, because his King's side pawns are shattered.  Now
games in which the Kings castle on different wings are more or
less beyond calculation, as pointed out before. On the whole, the
player who first attacks wins. But experience has shown that the
Queen's side is more difficult to defend on account of its
greater expanse, and this theory is supported by the present
game. In addition, White's development is not completed yet,
whilst all the Black forces are ready to strike.

          16. B-K3            Kt-Q2
          17. QKt-Q2          Kt-K4
          18. Castles         P-Kt4

Storming the position with pawns is peculiar to this kind of
game. The intention is to break up the opposing pawn position,
and to open files for the Rooks. Pawns are cheap in such cases.
Open lines for the pieces are the things that matter, and the
fewer pawns there are left, the more open lines are available for
the attack.

          19. PxP             Kt-Q6ch
          20. K-Kt1           QxP
          21. K-R1

The King was not safe on the diagonal. White wishes to push on
his King's side pawns (P-B4-B5, and so on). But after PxP e.p.
there would be a fatal discovered check by the Black Knight.

          22. ...             QxP

Black's advantage becomes more marked. He has recovered his pawn,
and for the ensuing attacks on both sides he is better placed,
having already two open files for his Rooks.

          22. P-KB4           P-QR4
          23. QR-Kt1          P-KB4

The position bristles with chances for daring sacrifices.  After
25. KtxBP, for instance, Black could play RxKt!; 26. PxR, Kt-Kt5;
27. PxKt, PxP; 28. P-R3 (Q-B4ch?, B-B2), B-B3; 29. K-R2, QxPch;
30. PxQ, RxP mate.


          25. P-Kt3           Q-Q2
          26. PxP             BxP
          27. Q-Kt2           P-B4

White's compulsory 25. P-Kt3 has weakened his QB3, and the move
in the text is intended to open the diagonal KB3-QB6 for the
Black Bishop.

          28. KtxB            QxKt
          29. QxP             B-B3
          30. Q-B4ch          K-R1
          31. Kt-K4           QR-K1

White cannot parry all the threats at once. Though he gets rid of
the threatening B, he lets in the hostile R on the K file and the
end cannot long be delayed.

          32. KtxB            RxKt

                Diag. 111

The idea underlying this pawn sacrifice is to open the K file for
the Rook. It will be seen that, with correct play, Black manages
to castle just in time, and White, though winning back his pawn,
has no advantage in position. The opening is seldom played by
modern masters.

Instead of the move in the text, White can hardly defend the KP
with Kt-B3, as Black simply captures the pawn and recovers his
piece by P-Q4, with a satisfactory position.  It is even better
for Black if White plays 6. BxPch in reply to 5. ... KtxP. The
capture of White's KP is far more important than that of the
Black KBP, particularly as the White Bishop, which could be
dangerous on the diagonal QR2-KKt8, is exchanged, e.g. 6. ...
KxB; 7. KtxKt, P-Q4; 8. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt1! Black continues P-KR3,
K-R2, R-B1 and has open lines for Rooks and Bishops.

          4. ...             KtxP

Black can, of course, develop his B-B4. Then he must either
submit to the Max Lange attack (5. P-Q4, PxP) or play BxP, giving
up the useful B, in which case he loses the pawn gained after 6.
KtxB, KtxKt; 7. P-KB4, P-Q3; 8. PxP, PxP; 9. B-KKt5, and
eventually Q-B3.

          5. P-Q4

R-K1 at once would lead to nothing.

                Diag. 112

  This attack has been analysed extensively by Steinitz.  The
only square where the Queen cannot be attacked at once by the
minor pieces is at QI. After 8. ... Q-QI, Black obtains quite a
satisfactory game: 9. RxKtch, B-K2; 10. KtxP, P-B4. This is
Pillsbury's move, intending to displace the Rook. Black has then
open lines for his two Bishops as compensation for his shattered
pawn position.  11. R-KB4, Castles; 12. KtxKt, QxQch; 13. KtxQ,
PxKt. Now it is not easy to find a reasonable plan for White, as
Black threatens to cramp White's game with B-Q3 and P-B5. It is
therefore necessary for White to take measures against that by
playing R-B4 and B-B4. If Black still plays B-Q3, B-B4 follows,
with the intention of exchanging and of provoking Black's P-B4,
which leaves the QP "backward."

          8. ...                 Q-KR4
          9. KtxKt               B-K2
         10. B-Kt5               B-K3
         11. BxB                 KtxB
         12. Kt-Kt3              Q-R3
         13. QxP                 Castles KR
         14. QR-Q1

Now White is ahead with his development, having both Rooks in
play and his Queen better placed. Nor can the latter be attacked
by R-Q1, as White would simply play QxR.  On the Queen being
driven away by the Black Knight, he exchanges the latter and
plays the Queen back into the same dominating position,
eventually producing a dislocation of the Black Queen's side
pawns.

         14. ...                Kt-B3
         15. Q-QR4              QR-Q1
         16. Kt-Q4!             KtxKt
         17. RxKt               RxR
         18. QxR                P-QKt3
         19. Q-K5               P-QB4

It is instructive to watch how this very slight weakness created
by Black's advance of his pawns brings him into trouble. A White
Knight settles down at his Q6, which is no longer guarded by the
Black QBP, and paralyses the whole of Black's game. Another
factor in White's superiority of position is the possession of
the King's file. The Black Rook cannot move until the King gets a
loophole by a pawn move.  As we have seen, such a pawn move often
affords an entry to the opposing pieces.

         20. P-KB4              B-B1

Not BxP, of course, because of P-QKt3 and Q-Kt2.  The Bishop
which cannot remain at K3 is to go to Kt2, so that the threat of
mate after Q-QB3 may also hold up a White piece.

         21. P-B5               B-Kt2
         22. Q-K7               Q-QB3
         23. R-K2               P-B3

Compulsory, as otherwise P-B6 forces the KtP to advance, which is
fatal in any case. After P-Kt3, White would cover his BP and play
his Q to KR6. On the other hand, after PxP there is Kt-R5-B6, and
Black is in a mating net.

         24. Kt-K4              Q-Q4
         25. Kt-Q6              B-B3

The threat was QxRch and R-K8 mate.

          26. P-KR3

in order to retreat to R2 in case of Q-Q8ch. In a way P-KR3
creates a certain weakness, as the square at Kt3 is now
defenceless, but Black has no pieces with which to take advantage
of it: his Rook cannot move, his Bishop is on the White squares.
If Black had a KB instead, the move would be very doubtful,
because then Black might break in through White's KKt3.

          26. ...                P-B5

White's threat was to repel the Black Queen by P-B4 and to mate
in five moves, beginning with Q-K6ch.

          27. P-B3               P-KR3

                Diag. 113

This disposes of the winning of the Queen by the threatened mate.
But it creates a weakness at Black's Kt3, which White exploits in
grand style. He decides to play the King himself to Kt6,
threatening mate at Kt7. In spite of several raids by the Black
Queen, this quaint device is crowned with success. The weakness
created by P-KR3 could not be demonstrated more drastically.

          28. K-R2          P-QKt4
          29. K-Kt3         P-QR4
          30. K-R4          P-Kt3

If White were to play PxP now, Black would mate him one move
earlier (Q-Kt4). Of course he parries the threat first, and Black
is helpless.

          31. R-K3           QxKtP
          32. R-Kt3          Q-B7

After P-Kt4ch White could not play 33. K-Kt4 on account of the
pretty mate by B-B6. He would play K-R5-Kt6.

          33. PxP            Q-B5ch
          34. R-Kt4          Q-B7ch
          35. K-R5           Resigns.

A most instructive game, showing how the superior position of the
pieces can lead indirectly to a win, by reducing the opponent's
pieces gradually to impotence and compelling him to move pawns,
thereby affording opportunities for a decisive entry.

B-K2 (see p. 39).

          5. P-Q4            B-K2

It is clearly very dangerous to gratify White's wish for an open
file by playing PxP. The move may be playable in the system of
defence called the "Riga variation" (see Game No. 17). Here it
would be advantageous to be able to close the KB's diagonal. It
is better when intending to play the "Riga variation" to have
played P-QR3 on the third move.

The manoeuvre cited on p. 40, namely Kt-B4-K3, which makes P-Q4
possible, is essential for the development of the QB. Black loses
the present game because White is able to keep the Bishop shut in
permanently

         11. Q-B4           Kt-B4

so that the pawn B3 should not be "hanging" when the QP moves.

                Diag. 114

After the exchanges the position is clearly in favour of White.
Against an undeveloped B, which also hampers a Rook, his Knight
is mobile. The Black Queen's side pawns are weak, and give White
winning chances even if Black succeeds in playing P-Q4 and
bringing the Bishop into play.  The move in the text, which
covers the pawn at B3, again prepares for P-Q4.

         15. Q-Q4           B-Kt2

The only chance lay in the pawn sacrifice by P-QB4, after which
the Bishop gets to Kt2 with a threat of mate, and the QR is free.

          16. Q-QKt4           B-B1
          17. Kt-K4

Fine play. If Black captures the pawn, White obtains a combined
attack with Q, R, and Kt, to which Black can only oppose the Q,
so that the result cannot be in doubt--e.g. 17. ... QxKP; 18. Kt-
B5, Q-Q3; 19. Q-QB4, RxRch; 20. RxR, P-KR3; 21. R-K8ch, K-R2; 22.
Q-K4ch, P-Kt3 (Q-Kt3?; 23. QxQ, followed by KtxP); 23.  Kt-Q3 and
R-K7.

          18. Kt-B5            R-Kt3
          19. R-K3             P-QR4
          20. Q-Q4             R-Kt1
          21. P-QB4

          25. RxR              PxR

Black has built a wall of pawns round his King, but it does not
avail against the superior forces which White can concentrate.

White's plan is clear. He will advance his pawns, and break up
those that surround the Black King, always taking care that Black
does not free his Queen's side meanwhile.  His pieces will then
break in easily, and Black is forced to look on passively.

          26. P-KR3            R-R1
          27. P-QR4

Black Rook into play.

his Queen's side, which he might have accomplished by the pawn
sacrifice of P-Q3.

Loss of the Queen and mate in a few moves cannot be prevented.
Black has played the whole game practically with two pieces less,
and the mate was really only a matter of time.

           Ruy Lopez (see p. 37).

           1. P-K4           P-K4

           3. B-Kt5          P-QR3
           4. B-R4

By exchanging the Bishop White could not prove P-QR3 to be a lost
move, for Black, by retaking with the QP, obtains open lines for
Q and QB, and in addition to an easy development, retains two
Bishops. This is a set-off against a certain weakness in Black's
game, which may be found in the fact that after P-Q4, PxP, White
has four pawns to three on the King's side, while his three pawns
on the Queen's side are able to hold the four opposing pawns, one
of which is doubled. But this weakness can only tell in the end-
game, which is too far ahead for practical purposes, and to which
it may not come at all. An example of the usual line of play will
be found in Game No. 18.

                Diag. 116

         8. ...              Castles

In Capablanca's opinion Black should not castle before White's
intentions in the centre have been made clear. It makes a great
difference whether White plays his QP to Q4 or to Q3 only.

If after 8. ... QKt-R4; 9. B-B2, P-B4 White plays:  10. P-Q4, his
intention is to move his pawn further to Q5 as soon as Black has
castled, and then to attack on the King's wing with QKt-Q2-B1-K3,
P-KKt4 and Kt-B5.  For this reason Black should force White to
disclose whether he intends to exchange his QP or to advance it
to Q5. In the latter case Black can refrain from castling
altogether and counter-attack on the King's wing, e.g., 10. P-Q4,
Q-B2; 11. P-KR3, B-Q2; 12. QKt-Q2, R-QB1; if now: 13.  P-Q5 then
P-R3 followed by P-Kt4-Kt5 gives Black many chances. If on the
contrary 13. PxP, then Black need no longer fear an attack on the
King's side after he has castled, as his Rooks will have a
favourable opportunity for operating on the open Queen's file.
However, there is still the disadvantage for Black of having
advanced Queen's side pawns, which are liable to attack (P-QR4).

The game takes a different course when Black exchanges the pawns
in the centre. The continuation would then be:  11. ... Kt-B3;
12. Q Kt-Q2, B-Q2; 13. Kt-B1, PxP; 14. PxP, PxP; 15. B-Kt5, Q-
Kt3. It is difficult to decide which side has the advantage.
Black has an extra pawn, but White has the initiative.

If in Diag. 116, after 8. ... Castles White plays 9. P-Q4 at
once, Black has an opportunity for the following interesting
attack: 9. P-Q4, B-Kt5; 10. B-K3, KtxKP; 11. B-Q5, Q-Q2; 12.
BxKKt, P-Q4; 13. B-B2, P-K5 14. P-KR3, B-R4; 15. Kt-K5, BxQ; 16.
KtxQ, BxB; 17. KtxR, RxKt. White cannot take advantage of his
Rooks, as there is no open file, whilst Black threatens to
initiate a strong attack with P-B4.

Aljechin has analysed a variation of this line of play, which he
thinks leads finally to White's advantage: 12. PxP, Kt-Kt4; 13.
BxKt, BxB; 14. P-KR3, BxKt; 15. QxB, KtxP; 16. RxKt, PxR; 17.
BxR, B-B8; 18. Kt-R3, Q-Q7. I doubt that White can win this game.

          9. P-Q3

In this less aggressive continuation, in which nothing is
immediately attempted against Black's centre, White prepares
gradually for a King's side attack, as in this game with Kt-Q2-
B1-Kt3. But Black should obtain time for operations in the
centre.

          9. ...                Kt-QR4
          10. B-B2              P-B4
          11. QKt-Q2            Kt-B3
          12. P-QR4

In many variations of the Ruy Lopez, this advance is always good,
if Black cannot avoid exchanging the pawn, because the White
Queen's Rook, which only gets into play with difficulty, can
either be exchanged or hold the Rook's file. In any case the
Black Knight's pawn is weak for the end-game. If, as in the
present game. Black can play P-Kt5, P-R4 is useless and even
doubtful, as the Rook's pawn itself may become weak in the end-
game.

          12. ...               B-Kt2

This causes the loss of the game. In the Ruy Lopez the Bishop is
nearly always needed on the diagonal QB1-KR6, to prevent a Knight
from settling at White's KB5, which otherwise cannot be repelled
except by P-KKt3, a most undesirable consummation. The proper
continuation would have been P-Kt5, B-K3, Q-B2 and P-Q4,
capturing the Queen's file. Compare note to move 13 in the next
game.

          13. Kt-B1             Q-B2

                Diag. 117

Here is the weakness. White first provides against Black's P-Q4,
and then starts a sharp attack on the King's side.

          15. B-Kt5           QR-Q1

P-Q4 at once is not feasible, because of BxKt.

          16. PxP             PxP
          17. Q-B1

This brings the Q away from her file, which Black could now
secure by P-Q4, followed by PxP.

          17. ...             KR-K1

The proper continuation is the one outlined in the note above.

          18. P-R3

White has now ample leisure to prepare the advance of his KBP.

          18. ...             R-R1
          19. RxR             RxR
          20. Kt-R2           B-QB1
          21. P-KB4           Kt-K1
          22. P-B5            BxB
          23. QxB             Q-K2

Black seeks salvation in exchanges, which White, of course, tries
to avoid, having good prospects of driving home his attack. His
pieces are concentrated on the King's side, whilst the Black
forces are scattered, and unable to get back in time for the
defence. Moreover, it is likely that the weakness at Black's KR3
and KB3 will prove fatal as the Black KB is exchanged.

          24. Q-R6            Q-B1
          25. Q-B1            Q-Kt2
          26. R-B1            P-Kt4

White was threatening to play Kt-Kt4 with PxP and Kt-R6.

          27. Kt-Kt4          Kt-B3
          28. KtxKtch         QxKt

One of the attacking Knights is eliminated. But there is another,
which forces the entry at KB6 and KKt6.

          29. P-R4

to gain access for the White Queen at KR6. If Black, captures
there follows: 30. Kt-R5, Q-Q1; 31. Q-R6, Q-B1; 32. Kt-B6ch, an
instructive example of the weakness created by P-KKt3.

          29. ...            P-R3
          30. Kt-R5          Q-Q1
          31. P-B6

All this is easy to understand.

          31. ...            K-R2
          32. PxP            B-Kt5
          33. Kt-Kt7         K-Kt3
          34. B-Q1           Q-Q2
          35. Kt-B5          BxKt
          36. PxBch          Resigns.

The conclusion might be: K-R2; 37. B-R5, PxP; 38. QxP, R-KKt1;
39. B-Kt6ch, PxB; 40. Q-R4 mate.

          10. B-B2          P-B4
          11. QKt-Q2        Q-B2

Supporting, as it does, the KP, this is not a lost move, although
White has not played P-Q4. It prepares Black's P-Q4 (after Kt-
B3), the KP being fully protected against White's double attack
by PxP.

          12. Kt-B1          Kt-B3
          13. Kt-K3          B-Kt2

The logical move would have been B-K3, to enforce P-Q4. Black is
then very well developed, whilst White labours under a somewhat
undeveloped Queen's side. An attempt to exert pressure in the
centre with P-Q4 in order to prevent Black's P-Q4 would be
belated. Black would gain the advantage by: l4. ... KPxP; 15.
PxP, PxP; 16. KtxP, KtxKt; 17. QxKt, Kt-Kt5! Nor would B-Kt5
before Kt-K3 be more successful; after B-K3; 14. Kt-K3, QR-Q1;
15. P-Q4, BPxP; 16. PxP, PxP; 17. KtxP, KtxKt; 18. QxKt, Q-B4,
Black has the better chances in the end-game. The move in the
text is not good because, as we saw before, the Bishop is wanted
on the other diagonal to cover the square at KB4.

          14. Kt-B5          KR-K1
          15. B-Kt5          Kt-Q2

Even now it was desirable to aim at P-Q4, therefore QR-Q1 was
preferable.

          16. B-Kt3

The position of the White pieces points to a dangerous menace to
the opposing King's side.

          16. ...             Kt-B1
          17. B-Q5!!

The beginning of a brilliant combination. BxKt is threatened, and
Black must first cover his B at K2.

          17. ...           Kt-Kt3
          18. BxB           KKtxB

QKtxB is not feasible, because of BxB and KtxQP.

                Diag. 119

Quite a number of charming combinations are hidden in this
position. If K-Kt3 or Kt1, then 21. KtxKtP! If K-B3 White can
capture the RP first with check.

          20. ...             K-Kt1
          21. Q-R5            KtxKt

          23. QxKtch         K-Kt1
          24. Q-Kt6!!!

The point. This prevents P-Kt3, which would allow Black to bring
up his Q for the defence at Kt2. Now nothing can be done against
the threatening R-K3-B3 or R3.

          24. ...             Q-Q2
          25. R-K 3           Resigns

A wonderful game in which Teichmann, the great judge of position,
proves himself also a master in hand-to-hand fighting, in the
wild chaos of sacrificial combinations.

                Diag. 120

In a game between Riga and Berlin PxP was tried for the first
time, a bold venture which anticipates White's desire to open the
King's file. After 7. R-K1 Black can defend the Kt by P-Q4, but
after 8. KtxP White threatens again to win the Kt by P-KB3,
besides attacking the QKt a second time. However, Black has a
surprising answer in readiness. He initiates a violent counter
attack which keeps White busy until Black, by castling, escapes
the dangers of the double pin. (Compare Game No. 17.)

          6. ...            P-QKt4
          7. B-Kt3          P-Q4
          8. P-QR4

This gives Black an opportunity of disposing of his QKt by
exchanging it, thereby enabling him to round off his pawn
position by P-QB4, at the same time threatening to cut off the
Bishop by P-B5. 8. PxP followed by P-B3 is the natural
continuation, as shown in the first part of this book, because
the Bishop, retreating to B2, can operate on a useful diagonal.

          8. ...            QKtxP!

QR-Kt1 would not be so good, because White obtains an open file
for his Rook. The move in the text is an absolutely valid
defence, as was proved by Schlechter in his match against Lasker.

          9. KtxKt          PxKt
         10. Kt-B3

PxP and P-B3 seems a more natural continuation.

         10. ...            KtxKt

Not PxKt, on account of BxP.

         11. PxKt           P-QB4
         12. RPxP           B-K2

in order to castle in reply to B-R4.

         13. Q-B3

Here White should have got back his second pawn by PxQP.  If then
13. ... P-B5; 14. B-R4, Castles; 15. PxP, BxP, White plays P-QB3,
providing a retreat for his R or B.  After the move in the text
this manoeuvre becomes impossible, because the B after P-B3 can
be attacked twice but has lost the support of the Queen.

         13. ...            B-K3
         14. RxP            Castles
         15. PxP            P-B5
         16. B-R2

Now the Bishop is hemmed in permanently; in other words, Black is
a piece up and must win easily. Therefore 16. B-R4 was compulsory
in order to get at any rate three pawns for the piece, thus: 16.
... B-Q2; 17. QxP, RxR; 18. PxR, BxB; 19. QxP.

         16. ...            RxR
         17. PxR            Q-R4
         18. B-Kt1          P-B6
         19. Q-Kt3

White tries to work up an attack on the King's side while Black
is still occupied on the other wing.

         19. ...               R-B1
         20. P-B4              B-KB4
         21. R-K1              B-B3
         22. K-R1

In order to answer BxQP by 23. B-K3 and P-R7, 22. ... QxP is not

                Diag. 121

The sequel forms an instructive example of how superior
development can afford winning chances even when there is no
immediate prospect of material gain. The opposing pieces are
gradually constricted until the defending lines are weakened by
compulsory pawn moves. In the present position Black quietly sets
to work to bring his Bishops to bear on the White King.

         26. ...                 B-K5
         27. K-R2                B-K2
         28. Q-B1

to free his game somewhat with P-B5, which Black prevents at
once.

           28. ...                P-B4
           29. R-K1               B-R5

Being probably short of time, Black makes a few irrelevant moves.
If his aim was not the opening of the KKt file but the subsequent
sacrifice of the Queen, he might have played Q-Kt7 at once,
followed by Q-Kt4.

           30. P-Kt3              B-K2

           37. R-Kt1              R-Kt3

Otherwise White might embark upon a counter attack, beginning
with P-Kt4. Now this is impossible on account of R-Kt3.

           38. R-K1               Q-Kt4
           39. Q-R5

After the exchange of Queens, Black would win easily by R-Kt7.
39. B-R2 also fails on account of QxQ; 40. RxQ, R-Kt7; 41. B-Kt3,
B-Q6!; 42. R-K5, BxP, and the passed pawn costs a Rook. With the
text move, White provokes the sacrifice of the Queen at Kt 8,
apparently not seeing the fine continuation at Black's disposal
on the forty-first move.

           39. ...                QxB!
           40. RxQ                RxR
           41. P-Kt4

Compulsory. B-Kt1 would be followed by R-QB8, etc.

           41. ...                B-B8!!
               Resigns.

There might follow 42. K-Kt3, P-Kt3; 43. Q-R4, BxPch; 44. KxB, P-
Kt4ch, and so on. 4l. ... B-Q3 would have given White a little
respite, though his game would still have been hopeless after PxP
and R-K8.

                Diag. 122

This is one of the most important positions in the Ruy Lopez.
Black has the better development, but his centre is less secure.
Whilst White has a pawn secured in the centre, Black has a Knight
there which will soon be driven away.  White's Q4, the basis of
his centre, is entirely in his hands, while Black's Q4 is exposed
to a steady pressure by the White pieces. Finally Black's Q Kt is
unfavourably placed, obstructing as it does the QBP and
preventing it from falling into line with its fellows. In
Petrograd, 1909, Lasker tried the following new defence: Kt-B4
followed by B-Kt5, giving up the moves gained before in order to
relieve the pressure on the Black QP and to exchange the same
ultimately at Q5.  The various possibilities of the position have
been discussed in connection with Diag. 22. It may be added that
after 10. ... Castles; QKt-Q2 is surely a better move than the
usual Kt-Q4, as the Queen's side should be developed before
undertaking an attack (11. ... Q-Q2?; 12. KtxB, followed by
RxKt). For a long time it was thought that after Kt-Q4 Black had
to exchange Knights, which enables White to make the pawn at QB7
"backward" by B-K3.  For Black must first play P-KR3 to guard his
Kt against the threat of P-B3 and P-KR4. However, a sensational
innovation which refutes the Kt's move was introduced in Breslau
in 1912. It is the following sacrifice:  10. ... Castles; 11. Kt-
Q4, KtxKP!; 12. P-B3, B-Q3!!; 13. PxKt, B-Kt5!!; 14. Q-Q2, Q-R5
with an overpowering attack.

         10. ...            Kt-B4
         11. B-B2           B-Kt5
         12. Q Kt-Q2        Castles
         13. Kt-Kt3         Kt-K5

Here Lasker played Kt-K3 against Janowski (Paris, 1912), but it
proved to be inferior, because 14. Q-Q3 disorganises Black's
King's side forcibly.

The move in the text is not really a pawn sacrifice. After 14.
BxKt, PxB; 15. QxQ, QRxQ; 16. KKt-Q4, KtxKt; 17. KtxKt, R-Q4,
White cannot play 18. RxP, because of P-QB4; 19. Kt-B2, B-B4 or
19. Kt-B3, R-Q8ch; 20. Kt-K1, B-B4; 21. R-K2, B-Q6; 22. R-K3, B-
Kt4.

         14. B-B4           P-B4
         15. PxP e.p.       KtxP(B3)
         16. Q-Q3           Kt-K5?

This loses the QBP, and weakens the QP. Black might have tried
BxKt; 17. QxB, B-Q3. It would then have been possible to support
the QP by P-B3 after moving the Kt away. If Black was anxious to
preserve his two Bishops he would even have risked P-Kt3. After
17. B-R6, R-B2, the Bishop could have been driven away again by
the KKt from Kt1 or Kt5. The open file offered some compensation
and chances of counter attack.

          17. BxP           Q-Q2

Not QxB because of QxPch.

          18. Kt-K5         KtxKt
          19. BxKt          B-R5

RxP is bad because of 20. RxKt, B-KB4; 21. Q-Kt3.

          20. B-Kt3         BxB
          21. RPxB          B-B4

Now RxP! was feasible with a level game after: 22. RxKt, B-B4!
23. KxR, BxR; 24. Q any, Q-B4ch, followed by BxB. After missing
this chance, Black soon loses the game.

          22. Q-Q4          KR-Q1
          23. QR-Q1         Q-QB2
          24. Kt-Q2         KtxKBP

A last and desperate attempt. Black obtains Rook and pawn against
two minor pieces, but has no time to initiate an attack with the
Rooks. The wisest plan was to give up the P, with a view to
effecting the exchange of the minor pieces, because an ending
with Queen and Rooks generally produces a draw. Black could not
play KtxKtP instead of the move in the text because of 25. B-
Kt3!.

         25. BxB            KtxR
         26. RxKt           QxKtP

         10. ...            Castles
         11. QKt-Q2

If Q-Q3, then Kt-R4; 12. QKt-Q2, P-QB4.

          11. ...            KtxKt

This furthers White's development, and should not be played
unless there is no other move available. To be considered are P-
B4 and B-KKt5. An argument against P-B4 is that White can deprive
Black's weak centre pawn of one protecting piece (12. PxP e.p.,
KtxP (B3); 13. Kt-Kt5), and experience has shown that White
obtains the superior game.

          12. QxKt                Kt-R4
          13. B-B2                Kt-B5

A very dangerous manoeuvre, as White can evade the exchange of
his Bishop and the Black Kt does not get back in time for the
defence of the K side, where White's attack becomes virulent. He
should have played P-QB4 followed by Kt-B3.

          14. Q-Q3                P-Kt3
          15. B-R6                KtxKtP
          16. Q-K2                R-K1
          17. Kt-Q4

Black had probably anticipated that White would be content with
regaining his pawn by BxP, but, with fine positional insight, he
retains his Bishop for the coming onslaught and speedily
concentrates his forces on the K side; whilst Black, who has won
a pawn at the expense of several moves, cannot mobilise an
equivalent number of pieces in time for the defence.

          17. ...                 Kt-B5
          18. P-B4                B-Q2

White was threatening 19. Kt-B6, 20. KtxB, 21. B-Kt5, 22. B-B6;
18. ... Q-Q2 is not sufficient, as 19. P-B5 would follow. Neither
can 18. ... B-QB4 be played because of 19. B-Kt5, Q-B1; 20. B-B6.
Preferable to the text move seems B-KB1 (19. B-Kt5, Q-B1; 20. B-
B6, B-Kt2), as then the Black pieces have more freedom of action.

          19. QR-K1          P-QB4
          20. P-K6

A brilliant sacrifice to which no satisfactory reply can be
found. For instance, 20. ... PxKt; 21. Q-Kt4, Kt-K6, 22. RxKt,
PxR; 23. P-B5, BxP; 24. PxB, PxP, 25. BxP, etc.; or 24. ... R-

etc.; or 21. ... B-B4; 22. PxPch, KxP; 23. BxPch, PxB; 24. P-B5,
etc. There are many variations, all leading to a speedy end.

          8. KtxP              B-Q3

This is the key to the variation. Black threatens to obtain a
draw by perpetual check through BxPch, followed by Q-R5ch and
QxPch. This is not good enough against a weaker opponent in a
tournament, and a strong player cannot afford to play the Riga
defence. But that is not a point against the variation. To prove
it unsound, White has to find a win.

          9. KtxKt             BxPch
         10. K-R1!

After 10. K-B1 Black has a tremendous attack, and drives it home
before White can manage to bring his extra piece into play. A
game Maroczy-Berger (Vienna, 1908) is an illustration of this. It
continued in this way: 10. K-B1, Q-R5; 11. B-K3, Castles; 12. Kt-
Q4, B-Kt5; 13. Kt-KB3, Q-R4. Now White has no satisfactory
continuation.  14. Kt-Q2 obstructs the Queen, and it is difficult

situation.

                Diag. 125

After the terrible slaughter, the position is somewhat clearer.
Black has a Rook and two pawns for two minor pieces, a slight
advantage for the end-game, but as yet there is no thought of an
end-game. White, in possession of two Bishops, with an open
Queen's file on which the Black King stands, has good attacking
chances, and most masters would think the position favourable for
White.

          14. ...                B-K3

P-KB4 is a plausible move, but is followed by a pretty mate by
15. B-Kt5. The move in the text threatens to eliminate the KB by
P-QB4, P-QKt4.

          15. B-K3           P-KB4
          16. Kt-B3          K-K2
          17. P-KKt4

Tarrasch recommends 17. R-Q1, threatening Kt-Q5ch.  If P-B3,
White could play 18. B-Kt6, thereby permanently preventing Black
from contesting the Queen's file, and then try to exchange
Black's B by Kt-K2-Q4. With two Bishops, White would then have
winning chances.

A subtle idea underlies White's move of P-KKt4. He wishes to take
advantage of the fact that Black has exchanged the KB by playing
P-Kt5, thus holding all the four pawns on the King's side. But
Black finds a surprising reply, which seems to refute White's
plan.

Capablanca played against Ed. Lasker (New York, 1915), 17. P-
KKt4, P-KKt3; 18. K-Kt3, P-KR4; 19. PxBP, P-R5ch; 20. K-R2, PxP;
21. Kt-K2, P-Kt4; 22. B-Kt3, BxB; 23. RPxB, KR-KKt1; 24. R-Q1,
QR-Q1; 25. RxR, KxR; 26. Kt-K4, winning a pawn.

          17. ...         P-KKt3
          18. P-Kt5       QR-KKt1!!

Black offers the exchange in order to get rid of White's QB.  If
White accepts the sacrifice, he loses his KKtP, and Black retains
three passed pawns for the piece, at least an equivalent for the
end-game. White should decline the doubtful gift and meet the
threat of P-R3 and P-KKt4 with 19. R-KKt1.

          19. B-Q4         P-R3
          20. B-B6ch       K-B2
          21. BxR          RxB
          22. R-Q1

in order to play 23. B-Q7 in answer to P-B4. This explains
White's check at move 20.

          22. ...          PxPch
          23. K-Kt2        K-B3!

If now 24. Kt-Q5ch, Black would assail the White King with K-K4;
25. KtxP, B-B5-K7-B6. The Black phalanx of pawns becomes
menacing.

           24. B-Kt3       BxB
           25. RPxB        K-K3
           26. P-Kt4       R-R2

Black need no longer fear to exchange Rooks, for he would then
threaten the Queen's side pawns with his King whilst the passed
pawns kept the White forces occupied.

          27. Kt-K2          R-Q2
          28. Kt-Q4ch        K-B3
          29. P-QB3          P-B3

The aim of this move is not clear. Black should adopt a forward
policy with P-Kt5, P-B5, R-R2, etc.

          30. R-KR1          P-Kt5
          31. R-R8

Now none of the pawns can advance: P-B5 would be answered by 32.
R-K8, R-K2; 33. RxR, KxR; 34. Kt-Kt3 and one of the pawns is
lost.

          39. R-Q6            R-K3
          40. R-Q1

White tries to win at all costs--and loses. By a forcible advance
on the Queen's side, he creates new chances, but also new
weaknesses.

          43. R-Q6           P-K6!
          44. P-B3

PxP fails on account of P-B6ch and R-R2.

          44. ...            P-K7
          45. Kt-K1          P-Kt6
          46. P-Kt5

Too late.

          54. Kt-Q3         P-R4
              Resigns

The RP cannot be prevented from pushing on to R6, after which a
mate is threatened by the BlacKRon the eighth rank. R-Q1 would
then be compulsory. But that lets the Black Rook in on the
seventh (KR-R7, followed by P-B7ch).


                GAME No. 18.

       Emanuel Lasker.     Capablanca.

           Ruy Lopez (see p. 37)

          1. P-K4          P-K4
          2. Kt-KB3        Kt-QB3

          4. BxKtQ         PxB
          5. P-Q4          PxP

Worthy of consideration is: 5. ... B-KKt5; 6PxP, QxQch; 7. KxQ,
Castles ch; 8. K-K2, R-K1; 9. P-KR3, BxKtch; 10. KxB, P-B3; with
a good game.  In this opening Black is justified in assuming the
initiative, as the exchange, which has opened a diagonal for his
QB, has furthered his development. If he does not do so, and
confines himself to defending tamely, the chances are that he
will lose on account of White's majority of pawns on the King's
side.

          6. QxP          QxQ

Compulsory. If B-K3 instead, 7. B-B4 attacks QB7.  B-Q3 in reply
to that would be inferior. By exchanging Bishops White would
render the Black QP "backward," and on the open file its capture
would be inevitable.

          7. KtxQ         B-Q3
          8. Kt-QB3       Kt-K2

Black prepares to castle on the King's side. It is more usual,
and probably stronger, to castle on the Queen's side, as the King
then protects the QBP, which in the present case would be weak if
Black's KB were to be exchanged.

                Diag. 126

Black allows his opponent too much latitude on the King's wing.
He should prevent White's P-B5, which obstructs his QB, by P-KB4.
After P-K5 the game would be equalised by B-B4, BxKt, and B-K3.

A draw would then be practically certain, with the Bishops of
opposite colours. Black probably thought White would not risk
weakening his KP by P-B5. But with unfailing judgment Lasker
foresees that, in consequence of the greater mobility of his
pieces, his attack will be successful before a counter attack on
the weak KP can be instituted.

          11. Kt-Kt3          P-B3

Even now P-KB4 was imperative, though it would keep the Bishop
from that square. The continuation could have been 12. P-K5, B-
Kt5; 13. Kt-K2 (or R4), Kt-Q4, and the Bishop is safe.

          12. P-B5!!

This move has a twofold aim. It shuts in the Bishop, and allows
B-B4, exchanging the Black QB.

          12. ...           P-QKt3

The diagonal QR1-KR8 is the only one in which the Bishop has any
prospects of action. However, as soon as he relinquishes his
present diagonal, a White Knight settles at K6 and the Black
Rooks are very much hampered.

          13. B-B4          B-Kt2

Black should have exchanged the Bishops. Now he gets a weak pawn
at Q3. Before playing B-Kt2, P-B4 should be played to prevent the
Knight getting from Kt3-Q4-K6.

          14. BxB          PxB
          15. Kt-Q4        QR-Q1

          18. R-B2         P-QKt4
          19. KR-Q2

This holds Black's Kt at B1. White's next move prevents the
Bishop getting into action by P-B4. After depriving all the Black
pieces of their mobility, White turns his attention to a
determined assault on the Black King.

          19. ...              QR-K2
          20. P-QKt4           K-B2

          26. PxP              R(R2)-K2

There are no prospects on the Rook's file, and Black is
restricted to keeping his pieces mutually protected. He cannot
prevent White from penetrating the King's side.

          27. K-B3          R-Kt1
          28. K-B4          P-Kt3
          29. R-Kt3         P-Kt4ch
          30. K-B3

If Black captures the pawn, he would lose it again forthwith
through White's R-R3, and the pawn at R3 would also be captured.

                Diag. 127

The White King leaves the diagonal because Black's P-B4 would
interfere with the combination by which White intends to
annihilate Black's game in a few moves.

          37. Kt(K6)-B5           B-B1

Black dares not move the Rook on account of KtxB and Kt-Q6ch.

          38. KtxR                BxKt
          39. R-R7ch              R-B1

          42. Kt-B5               Resigns

Mate in two is threatened. Black's only move is Kt-K2, after
which he is helpless, and White can capture the pawns one by one
at his leisure (R-B7, etc.). In this game, so beautifully
engineered by White, we have a further example of Lasker's
remarkable grasp of position.

It is, of course, better to castle before playing P-Q3, as the
opponent could at once play Kt-Q5 and utilise the pin to initiate
an immediate attack, e.g. 5. Castles, P-Q3; 6. Kt-Q5, B-B4; 7. P-
Q4, PxP; 8. B-Kt5.

                Diag. 128.

The position is not unlike that in Diagram 90, and the same
remarks apply to it. Here B-K3 is inadvisable, because P-Q4,
threatening to fork two pieces, forces the exchange of Black's
centre pawn. After 7. ... B-Kt5; 8. Kt-Q5, Kt-Q5; 9. B-B4, B-B4,
on the other hand, we get the position discussed on p. 115, in
which White obtains the advantage by Q-Q2. Instead of 9. ... B-
B4, Black should play Q-Q2 with a similar threat. But he has not
the cooperation of his King's Bishop for the attack, and White
just manages to escape with a draw, e.g. 9. ... Q-Q2; 10.
KtxKtch, PxKt; 11. BxP, P-KR3(BxKt; 12. PxB, Q-R6 fails on
account of K-R1 and R-KKt1); 12. P-B3, KtxKtch; 13. PxKt, B-KR4;
14. K-R1, K-R2 (Diagram 129); 15. R-KKt1.

                Diag. 120.

This is the saving clause. If now Black had his B at B4, as White
has in the corresponding attack, White would first have to
protect his BP with 15 Q-K2, and would be lost after R-KKt1; 16.
R-KKt1, R-Kt3; as 17. B-R4 fails because of Q-R6; 18. B-KKt3, R-
B3; and on the other hand, after 17. RxR, PxR Black plays R-KB1,
attacking the BP a second time.

With the Black Bishop at Kt5, however, Black does not succeed.
The continuation could be l5. ... R-KKt1; 16.  R-Kt3, R-Kt3; 17.
B-R4, with a probable draw.

This line of play is most difficult for both sides, and it has
been avoided so far in tournaments.

In Diagram 128 the favourite continuation for many years was: 7.
... BxKt; 8. PxB, Kt-K2. The opening of the KKt file by 9. BxKKt
is not to be feared, because of the reasons given when discussing
Diagram 90. But White obtains the advantage with 9. Kt-R4,
preparing the opening of the KB file by P-B4 and PxP. 9. ... Kt-
Kt3, in order to retake with the BP after 10. KtxKt and to open
the file for Black's Rooks, is not a sufficient reply, because
after 11. P-B4 and PxP White has a clear advantage, having an
extra pawn in effect for the end-game. For the three Black pawns
on the King's side are held by the two adverse pawns, which they
cannot pass.

The attempt to expel the troublesome Bishop after 9. ... Kt-K1 by
P-KB3, and then play for a centre by P-B3, Kt-B2 and P-Q4 fails
on account of the withering attack which White obtains on the KB
file, e.g. 9. ... Kt-K1; 10. B-QB4, K-R1; 11. P-B4, P-KB3; 12. Q-
R5, PxB; 13. PxP, etc.

In consequence the defence by 7. ... BxKt and Kt-K2 has been
abandoned.

In the present game Black reverts to a very old defence,
comprising the moves: BxKt, Q-K2, Kt-Q1-K3. It had been abandoned
because White, by playing R-K1, P-Q4, and eventually B-B1 and B-
R3, forces the exchange of Black's centre pawn, and obtains an
advantage, on well-known grounds. Here Black strengthens the
defence by interpolating P-KR3!, after which White must come to a
decision as to maintaining the pin. If he decides to do so the
White Bishop will no longer be able to threaten the Black Queen
from QR3.

          7. ...                 BxKt
          8. PxB                 P-KR3
          9. B-KR4

If the B retreats to B1 or K3, Black can adopt the defence Kt-K2-
Kt3. Then Kt-R4 would be inferior, because Black can simply play
P-KKt4. In this case the advance of the pawns is justified,
because Black can bring his QKt to KKt3 and have practically one
piece more on the King's side, and good prospects for the attack
which he can open with K-R2, R-KKt1, Kt-Kt3-B5.

          9. ...                 Q-K2

P-KKt4 would be premature. White would win at once by 10. KtxKtP,
PxKt; 11. BxP, as he can attack the Knight a second time by P-KB4
and PxP before Black can either protect it sufficiently or
relieve the "pin."

         10. Q-Q2                Kt-Q1
         11. P-Q4                B-Kt5
         12. Q-K3                BxKt
         13. QxB                 Kt-K3

It would be wrong to play for the gain of a pawn with P-KKt4 and
PxP, e.g. 13. ... P-KKt4; 14. B-Kt3, PxP; 15. R-K1!, PxP; 16. P-
K5, etc.

         14. BxKt

Black's threat was to develop an attack, similar to that
described at move 9, with P-KKt4 and Kt-B5.

         14. ...                 QxB
         15. QxQ                 PxQ
         16. B-B4

in order to exchange the Knight, which is generally superior to a
Bishop in an end-game, as mentioned before.

         16. ...                 PxP
         17. BxKt                PxB

                Diag. 130

In the end-game thus brought about the White Rooks have more
freedom, as they can be mobilised easily on the third rank to act
on either wing. Black's pawns, however, are stronger, being
easily protected by the King, whilst White's weak pawns at QR2
and QB2 are at too great a distance from the King; therefore
White must see to it that Black does not open files for his Rooks
on the Queen's side.

         18. ...                 QR-B1
         19. QR-Kt1              P-Kt3
         20. KR-Q1               KR-Q1
         21. R-Kt3

White must now allow Black to occupy the QB or Q file.  After 21.
P-Q5 Black would simply play PxP; 22. PxP, P-B3, with a certain
draw.

         21. ...                 P-Q4
         22. R-Kt3ch

P-KB3 was the correct move here, in view of subsequent threats of
mate.

         22. ...                 K-B2
         23. PxP                 RxP
         24. R-QR3               P-QR4
         25. P-KB4?

A mistake under time pressure, costing a pawn. QR-Q3 was the
move.

         25. ...                 P-QB4
         26. R-QB3               QR-Q1

         29. P-KR3               R-Q7
         30. R-Kt5

Not RxP, on account of R-B7, and the KKtP cannot be saved.

         30. ...                 R-(B5)B7
         31. R-KKt3              P-B4
         32. P-B4                P-B5
         33. R-KKt4              P-R4
         34. R-Kt5               RxP
         35. P-R4

Mate was threatened in a few moves through R-QB7-B8 and R(R7)-R8.

         35. ...                R-(B7)Kt7

If now R-B7, White would win the KBP or obtain a perpetual check
(36. R-QKt7ch, followed by R-QKt8-KB8).   After the move in the
text, White can still draw, as he wins back his pawn.

         36. RxR                RxR
         37. RxRP?

This careless move now loses the game. Of course White should
have taken the BP. If then P-R5, R-R5 held the pawn from behind,
also after 37. ... K-B3; 38. RxQRP, P-K4, a draw would have been
the result, as the White BP would soon have become threatening,
e.g. 39. R-R8, K-B4; 40. P-B5, P-K5; 41. P-B6, R-QB7; 42. R-QB8,
K-Kt5; 43. P-B7, KxP; 44. K-R2, P-K6; 45. R-B8, RxP; 46. RxPch,
K-Kt4; 47. R-K4, R-B6; 48. K-Kt3, etc.; or 44. R-K8, RxP; 45.
RxP, K-Kt6; 46. R-K1, R-B7; 47. K-R1, RxP; 48. R-K3ch, and so on.

         38. RxP                P-R6

After R-R5 there follows P-R7 and R-Kt8ch, or (if 40. K-R 2) P-
B6.


                 GAME No. 20

   White: Eduard Lasker.    Black: Englund.

             Four Knights' Game.

          1. P-K4               P-K4
          2. Kt-KB3             Kt-QB3

          4. B-Kt5              Kt-Q5
          5. KtxP

Black can now get White's KP by playing Q-K2, and moreover
exchange White's valuable Bishop. Instead of the move in the text
it is advisable to retire the Bishop to R4 or B4, or else to play
5. KtxKt, PxKt; 6. P-K5, PxKt; 7. PxKt. Black would then play QxP
and not PxQPch, as the latter move allows White to develop
quickly, and Black has no time to castle--e.g. 8. BxP, QxP; 9.
Castles, B-K2; 10. B-B3, followed by R-K1.

          5. ...              Q-K2

                Diag. 131.

  Here KtxB was essential, followed by QxP, freeing the Bishop.
After 7. KtxKt, QxPch; 8. Q-K2, QxQch; 9. KxQ, Kt-Q4 (10. P-B4,
P-QR3), Black completes his development a little later (10. R-K1,
P-KB3; 11. K-B1ch, K-B2), but after the exchange of Queens there
is not much to fear from an immediate attack, and the value of
the two Bishops soon asserts itself. In a match game Ed. Lasker-
Cole (London, 1913) the continuation was 12. P-Q4, P-QR3; 13. Kt-
B3, KtxKt; 14. PxKt, P-Q4. Here the doubled pawn is a
disadvantage, in that the pawn at B2 is immobile, and constantly
liable to be attacked by B-B4. P-Q3 was the better move.

          7. Castles         KtxKt

Now KtxB was no longer possible. After KtxQKt there would be
threats of KtxBP as well as of R-K1 and P-Q3.  The game is almost
lost for Black at this stage, as the King cannot escape the
impending attack on the K file by castling.

          8. QPxKt           KtxKtch
          9. QxKt            Q-B4
         10. R-K1ch         B-K2
         11. B-Q3

prevents castling, as Q-K4 would win a piece.

         11. ...             P-Q4
         12. B-K3

White has the development of the B gratis, as Black must lose
time with the Queen.

         12. ...             Q-Q3
         13. B-KB4           Q-KB3
         14. QxP!!

Black being behind with his development is already threatened by
sacrificial combinations. If he takes the Bishop he loses by 15.
B-Kt5ch, K-B1; 16. Q-Q8ch!, BxQ; 17. R-K8 mate, or l5. ... P-B3;
16. BxPch, and so on.

         14. ...             P-B3
         15. Q-K4            B-K3
         16. R-K3            B-QB4

Here Black might have castled on the Queen's side, but R-Q1 would
have had much the same sequel as in the actual game.

         17. B-K5            Q-R3
         18. R-Kt3           B-KB1

A sorry retreat. But after Q-Q7, which may have been Black's
original intention, White plays R-KB1, threatening B-KB4.

         19. R-Q1

This move completes White's development, and only seems to give
Black a chance of castling. However, Black has no satisfactory
continuation.

         19. ...                 Castles?
         20. QxPch               PxQ

           Three Knights' Defence.

          1. P-K4                P-K4
          2. Kt-KB3              Kt-QB3
          3. Kt-B3               B-Kt5
          4. Kt-Q5

Developing another piece by B-Kt5 or B4 would be more in
accordance with principle.

          4. ...                 B-K2

There was a threat of KtxB and KtxP. If Black plays P-Q3, the B
must retire all the same after 5. B-Kt5. It seems best to retire
the B to K2 rather than to B4 or R4, because there remains the
threat of a pin subsequently by B-KKt5, which might become
serious with the Knight at Q5.

          5. B-B4                Kt-B3
          6. P-Q3                P-Q3
          7. KtxB                QxKt
          8. P-B3                P-KR3

The KKt is to support the advance of P-Q4 subsequently, and that
is why Black does not want to allow it to be pinned. This is
sound strategy, since White has exchanged his QKt, which from B3
prevents P-Q4 in the ordinary way.

          9. B-K3                Castles
         10. Q-Q2                B-K3

                Diag. 132

         13. PxP

The second mistake. Unimportant as it seems, it leads to the loss
of the game. White did not defend the pawn by Q-B2, because it
would have proved 10. Q-Q2 to have been a lost move. But giving
up the centre is a far greater evil. Black now commands his Q5
and KB5, and this enables him to start an attack to which there
is no defence. The game shows conclusively how important it is to
maintain the centre.

         15. P-QKt4            P-QKt3
         16. Q-K2

to prevent P-K5, which would now be countered by PxP and Q-B4.
However, as P-K5 cannot be prevented permanently, and the Q must
move in any case, Q-B2 would have been the better move, as there
the Queen cannot be molested by a Rook.

         16. ...               Q-Q3

         19. R-R4             QR-K1!

Black's game is beautifully developed, whilst White cannot make a
combined effort. The Black Rooks are particularly well placed,
and threaten to take an effective part in the attack in various
ways. All this is the outcome of White losing the centre.

          20. P-KKt3

Though this prevents Kt(Q 4)-B5, it weakens KB3, which is all the
more serious as Black threatens to open the file by P-B5.

          20. ...             Q-Q2

If now White refrains from taking the pawn, Black plays P-QR4!

          21. RxP             P-K5
          22. Kt-Q4           PxP

          24. Q-K2            P-B5

All the avenues of attack are now open, and White's game
collapses quickly.

KKt-Q2 is better, because it would support the advance of P-QB4
and also be of use eventually in an attack on White's centre by
P-KB3. The text move allows the exchange of two minor pieces,
which can only be to White's advantage, as Black cannot get his
QB into play, and is for a long time practically a piece down.

          6. KtxKt           BxB

After PxKt the pawn would be very weak, and could hardly be held
for long.

So far the game is easy to understand in the light of the remarks
made on page 44, when treating of the openings.  The continuation
shows in an instructive fashion that White's attack is the more
effective, being directed against the King's side.

          17. P-B5!         KPxP

This sacrifice of a pawn in conjunction with a second sacrifice
on the next move, produces a combination of rare beauty.

          18. P-Kt4!!       PxP

If Black did not capture White would. In either case the storming
of the position by pawns achieves its object and the lines of
attack are free for the pieces.

          19. Kt-Kt5        P-Kt3

Now that White has made an opening for himself at KB6, the rest
is easy. 19. ... P-R3 is of no avail. The sequel might have been:
20 Kt-R 7, KR-Q1; 21 Kt-B6ch, after which White wins after either
PxKt; 22 QxP, or K-R1 KtxP.

          20. R-B6          K-Kt2

Black gets no breathing space. If P-R3, then 21 BxP.

          4. B-Kt5          PxP
          5. BxKt           PxB

If the Queen recaptures, White obtains too great an advantage in
development, and therefore Black submits to the doubling of his
pawns. It is doubtful if this means a handicap, although the
King's side gets broken up. For Black keeps his two Bishops, a
powerful weapon, unless White succeeds in developing swiftly an
attack on the King's side. The present game is instructive and
shows the chances afforded to both sides by the position brought
about by the exchange at KB6.

          6. KtxP           P-KB4

As the KB obtains a long diagonal at Kt2, this advance is
justified. Otherwise there would be strong objections to it, as
the pawn is likely to be subjected to attack, and apart from
that, it gives up command of Black's K4.

          7. Kt-QB3

Kt-Kt3 would seem more natural, firstly, because Black has
weaknesses on the K side, and White will need his pieces for
attack in that quarter, and secondly, because the QP ought to be
supported by P-B3, as Black will attack it by B-Kt2.

          7. ...            B-Kt2
          8. Kt-B3          Castles
          9. B-B4

If now the Knight were at Kt3, White could play P-B3 and BQ3.
This is the proper place for the B, which might obtain an open
diagonal after P-KKt4.

          9. ...            Kt-B3

         11. B-Q3           P-B4
         12. P-B3           P-QB5

P-Kt3 seems preferable, as the text move releases the hold on
White's Q4. The isolated pawn resulting after 13. PxP is not to
be feared, as the B at Kt2 would have greater efficiency (QR-
Kt1), and White would not be so firmly established in the centre.

         13. B-B2           P-Kt4
         14. Q-Q2

There now ensues an interesting struggle. White builds up an
attack with Q and both Knights and eventually the B  (P-KKt4). If
Black can manage to play his King into safety at R1 in time, and
then occupies the Kt file with his Rooks, he would have the
better of it, his pieces having by far the greater range of
action.

         14. ...               B-Kt2
         15. Q-B4              Q-B3

K-R1 and KR-Kt1 might be considered.

         17. Q-B7              Q-Q1
         18. Q-K5

White gains a move by attacking the Knight's Pawn. It may seem
far fetched if I now point out that this could not have happened
if from the first Black had given preference to the pawn
formation at QKt3 and B4 instead of Kt4 and B5, though the whole
game would almost certainly have taken a different course. Still,
when advancing a pawn into an unprotected position there always
is the risk of its becoming the object of an attack at an
opportune moment, and whenever the plan of development does not
necessitate such moves they are best avoided.

The last moves have decided the game. Both players have
overlooked that 20. Q-B6 would have won a pawn at least  (QxQ,
21. KtxQch with KtxB and BxP). 20. ... BxKt leads to an immediate
loss by 21. QxB, BxKt; 22. QxB followed by P-KKt4! with an
overwhelming attack.

Instead of 19. ... Kt-B3, Black should have played P-B3, followed
by K-R1 and the occupation of the Kt file by the Rooks. White's
last move allows him to de this with even greater effect.

         21. Q-R3              R-KKt1

Black has now a preponderance of material on the field of battle,
and it can be concluded off-hand that White, not being able to
bring his Rooks into play, must lose.

         22. Kt-Kt3            Q-B3
         23. K-B1

K-K2 is a shade better. But there is no longer any adequate

         31. KxB               R-Q1
         32. P-B4

R-Q1 is much more promising, although it means the loss of a pawn
(RxR and B-B8, etc.). With Bishops of different colour the game
is not easy to win even now.

          7. Kt-Kt5

The intention is to strengthen the centre by P-QB3.  Though it
takes a number of moves to bring the Knight into play again, yet
most of the tournament games in this variation have been won by
White, mostly through a King's side attack on the lines set out
in the notes to Game No. 22.  Investigations by Alapin tend to
show that this is due to the fact that Black in all cases devoted
his attention to Queen's side operations (just as in Game No. 22)
when he could have utilised White's backward development, by
himself starting a counter attack on the King's side. He can then
either aim at the White centre at once with P-KB3, or else play
P-KB4 and prepare the advance of the KKtP by Kt-B3-Q1-B2.  These
various lines of play are still under discussion. Simple
development is probably preferable to the move in the text, e.g.
7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. P-B4, P-QB4; 9. Kt-B3.

          7. ...            K-Q1

There can be no advantage in forfeiting the option of castling
unless there be no other way of getting the King into safety and
of bringing the Rooks into concerted action. It is obvious that
otherwise the free development of pieces is hindered, and the
King is in appreciable danger, for it is easier to open files in
the centre than on the wings where the pawns have not advanced
yet. Therefore Kt-Kt3 is the only move worth considering.

          8. P-QB3           P-KB3
          9. PxP

With the Black King remaining in the centre, White has no further
interest in the maintenance of his pawn at K5. On the contrary he
will try to clear the centre.

          9. ...             PxP
         10. Q-Q2            P-B3
         11. Kt-QR3          Kt-B1

At this early stage it is clear that Black will have to contend
with difficulties in trying to complete his development.   The
usual way (P-QB4) is barred on account of the dangers to Black's
King with which a clearance in the centre is fraught.

         12. Kt-B3           B-Q2
         13. P-KKt3!

As Black can force this advance at any time by playing R-KKt1,
White decides to develop his KB at Kt2, thereby covering his KB3
and KR3. The weakness of the latter squares would not be of any
great moment if White were to castle on the Queen's wing. But as
P-QB4 is necessary in order to break up the centre, castling KR
is the right course.

         21. Kt-Q2               Q-B1
         22. P-QR4!

White wishes to get rid of the pawn at Black's Kt3, in order to
break in with his Knight at B5. Black has no means of preventing
this, and soon succumbs to the overwhelming array of White
forces.

                Diag. 136

This line of defence, called the McCutcheon variation, was
recommended for many years by Tarrasch as being the strongest.
The most obvious continuation 5. P-K5 leads to complications, and
the final verdict has not yet been reached.  After 5. ... P-KR3,
the best continuation is thought to be:  6. PxKt, PxB; 7. PxP, R-
Kt1; 8. P-KR4, PxP; 9. Q-R5, Q-B3; 10. QxRP, QxP.

White has an easy development, whilst Black, as in most
variations in the French defence, finds it difficult to bring his
QB into play. After P-KR3, it is not advisable to retire the
Bishop; 6. B-R4, P-KKt4; 7. B-Kt3, for here the Bishop is out of
play, and Black's King's Knight being free can play to K5 for
concerted action with Black's KB.  Lasker's continuation in the
present instance is at once simple and effective. It leads to an
entirely different system of development.

          5. PxP             QxP

If Black recaptures with the pawn, he must lose a move with the
Bishop in order to avoid getting an isolated doubled pawn after
6. Q-B3. The doubled pawn which Black may get after the move in
the text would not be isolated, and therefore not necessarily
weak. It could become a weakness if Black were to castle on the
King's side. But otherwise it might even become a source of
strength, supporting, as it would, an advance of Black's KP
against the White centre.

          6. Kt-B3          P-B4?

Black should retain the option of castling QR, in case White
exchanges at his KB6; P-QKt3 and B-Kt2 would have been better.

The Black position has any number of weaknesses. The King cannot
castle into safety; the pawn position is full of holes, and open
to attack. White takes full advantage of this and wins in
masterly fashion with a few strokes.

Whatever Black plays now, he must create some weakness in order
to provide against White's Q-R3, BxKt, QxRP, and White's attack
must succeed. The whole of Black's plan is thus frustrated, as
the only reason for abandoning the centre by PxP was the
occupation of the long diagonal by the QB.  Now the Queen's side
pieces cannot get into play without much difficulty, and by the
time they have succeeded it is too late.

Black plays P-KKt3 with the same intention, White plays P-KR4-5
and PxP, and brings the Rook into play.

P-KR3 would lead to an immediate disaster: 13. BxP, PxB; 14.
QxRP, P-KB4; 15. P-KKt4. The move in the text avoids the
immediate attack on the King, but the King's Pawn is now
"backward," and White immediately fastens on this weakness.

GAME NO. 27

White: Niemzowitsch. Black: Tarrasch.  French Defence.

          1. P-K4           P-QB4

This opening is called the Sicilian Defence. White, however,
adopts a continuation which leads into a variation of the French
Defence.

          2. P-QB3          P-K3
          3. P-Q4           P-Q4

          5. Kt-B3          Q-Kt3
          6. B-Q3           PxP

Black seeks to demonstrate that White's QP is weak. The present
game, however, seems to prove that White is able to guard it
adequately, thus permanently supporting the KP too.  It would
therefore appear to be better to attack the KP itself, and to
play P-B3 on the fifth move. Now B-Q2 would be better than the
text move. As White cannot give further support to his Q4, he
would have to play PxP, and the protection of the K5 would have
to be undertaken by pieces, which is not desirable.

          7. PxP           B-Q2

Not KtxP, 8. KtxKt, QxKt, because of B-Kt5ch.

          8. B-K2

The B cannot go to B2 on account of Kt-Kt5 and B-Kt4.

          9. P-QKt3        Kt-B4
         10. B-Kt2

Now White's centre is safe from further attacks. True, White has
forfeited castling, but as he dominates the King's side, where
Black cannot undertake anything, there is no harm in P-Kt3,
preparatory to "artificial castling."

         10. ...           B-Kt5ch

                Diag. 139

This manoeuvre is unwise; White counters with 13. P-QR4, a move
which was necessary in any case, in order to develop the QKt via
R3, this being the Knight's only chance of getting into play,
because, as long as the QP is attacked three times the lines of B
and Q must not be interrupted. That is a weakness in White's
game, and it was necessary for Black to prevent his Kt being
driven off by P-KKt4. P-KR4 was the correct move. Then White also
had to play P-KR4 to prevent P-KKt4-5, in which case Black could
have played l3. ... P-KKt3, and have brought his Rooks into
concerted action. P-KKt3 would have been necessary before
castling, because White's B-Q3 would have attacked the KKt. The
latter could not then capture the Queen's Pawn on account of a
discovered check, e.g. l2. ... Castles; 13 B-Q3, KtxP?; 14 KtxKt,
KtxKt; 15 BxKt, QxB?; 16 B-R7ch, and QxQ.

In Diagram 139 Black's P-QR4 is not only a lost move, but
moreover allows a White piece to settle permanently at QKt5. It
also prevents the Knight from playing to QR4, from where White's
P-QR4 could be answered by Kt-Kt6 eventually.

          13. P-QR4         R-QB1
          14. B-Kt5         Kt-Kt5

All these skirmishes only result in the exchange of pieces, and
as long as Black's KRis out of play this can only be of advantage
to White.

          15. Kt-B3         Kt-QR3

This is in order to drive off the B. Black should have exchanged
his own inactive QB, as the White B might become effective on the
Diagonal QKt1-KR7, whilst Black's QB has no future.

          16. K-Kt2         Kt-B2
          17. B-K2          B-Kt5

Black cannot yet castle, because of 18. B-Q3 Kt-KR3, 19. B-QB1).

          21. KtxB           QKtxKt
          22. B-Kt1

White's last eight moves completed his development, and his
Bishops lie in wait for the attack on the Black King.  Meanwhile
Black has effected nothing. On the contrary, he

has exchanged his valuable KB, and also allowed his KKt to be
driven off. His King's side is bare, and castling would be
fraught with danger. If Black castles now, White plays Kt-Kt5,
and Black must weaken his position by P-R3 or P-Kt3, and White
would advance his KtP or RP and force an exchange, opening a file
for his Rook. In consequence Black decides to forfeit castling
and to bring his KR to bear on the KB file. For this also Black
must first play P-R3, and White obtains an open file by P-Kt4-
Kt5. The sequel is shown here.

This provides against Black attempting to free his Bishop by P-
K4. Black's B-Q2 is countered by B-Kt6ch. White new wins
surprisingly quickly, through the greater mobility of his pieces.

                 GAME No. 28

        White: Alapin.      Black: Rubinstein.

               Sicilian Defence.

          1. P-K4          P-QB4

At first glance this move would seem to lose time, as it does
nothing towards the main object of opening strategy, namely, the
development of pieces. But we shall find that
 it does contribute to that aim, although indirectly. For one
thing it could, by a transposition of moves, lead into an opening
in which P-QB4 is played in any case; in other openings it is of
use, in that it acts from the first against the formation of a
strong white centre. Concurrently it prepares the opening of a
file for the Rooks.

          2. Kt-KB3          Kt-KB3?

Black should not play Kt-KB3 as long as White's P-K5 means the
clear gain of a move. There are plenty of developing moves to
choose from.

Two systems of development can be followed by Black according to
whether the KB is to develop at K2 or Kt2. In the first case
(compare Game No. 29) P-K3 is played. In the second case, the
opening might take this course: 2. ... Kt-QB3; 3. P-Q4, PxP; 4.
KtxP, Kt-B3; 5. Kt-QB3, P-Q3 (not P-KKt3 at once, because White
would exchange Knights and drive off the KKt by P-K5); 6. B-K3,
P-KKt3, and B-Kt2. White's position is superior, as he has a pawn
in the centre in conjunction with greater mobility. Black will
find it difficult to bring his QB into play. Nevertheless his
position is compact and difficult to get at.

          3. P-K5

Undoubtedly Rubinstein had taken this move into account when
playing 2. ... Kt-KB3. His idea was to provoke the advance of the
KP. The pawn at K5 is weaker than at K4, particularly as Black's
QBP prevents its natural support by P-Q4. Moreover Black's Q4 is
free from interference by White. White refutes this ultra
subtilty by simple and straight-forward play, and he gets such an
advantage in development that his attack succeeds before Black is
able to demonstrate any weakness in White's game.

          3. ...            Kt-Q4
          4. Kt-B3          KtxKt
          5. QPxKt          Kt-B3
          6. B-QB4          P-Q3

After 6 ... P-K3, 7. B-B4 would restrain the QP.

          7. B-B4           PxP

At this early stage Black has no satisfactory means of
development. The QP is attacked three times, and therefore the KP
cannot move, nor can the KB be developed at Kt2.  B-Kt5, in order
to play BxKt and PxP, is refuted by BxPch. The move in the text
which brings about the exchange of Queens, but develops another
White piece at the same time, is more or less forced. It is
instructive to watch how White's advantage in development soon
materialises.

          8. KtxP          QxQch
          9. RxQ           KtxKt
         10. BxKt          P-QR3

White's threat of B-Kt5ch could not be parried by B-Q2 because of
11. BxPch.

                 GAME No. 29

     White: Teichmann.     Black: Spielmann.

         Sicilian Defence (see p. 215).

          1. P-K4          P-QB4
          2. Kt-QB3        P-K3
          3. KKt-K2

This comes to the same as Kt-B3, as after P-Q4, PxP the Knight
recaptures. If, however, Black plays P-Q4 there is a certain
advantage for White to have the Kt at K2, e.g. 3. ... P-Q4; 4.
PxP, PxP; 5. P-Q4. If now Black does not exchange pawns, White is
able to bring his KB to bear on the centre after P-KKt3 and B-
Kt2.

          3. ...          Kt-QB3

White can exchange this Knight later on, and thus make P-K5
possible as soon as he should deem it advisable to drive the
Black Knight from his KB3, where the same is bound to develop
sooner or later. It is perhaps wise to prevent P-K5 by Q-B2
instead of the move in the text. This is an old defence,
introduced by Paulsen. Though it retards the development of
Black's minor pieces, it produces a strong defensive position,
and the opening of the QB file gives attacking chances on the
Queen's side. The defence might run like this: 3. ... P-QR3; 4.
P-Q4, PxP; 5. KtxP, Q-B2; 6. B-K3, Kt-KB3; 7. B-K2, B-K2; 8.

                Diag.  #142

As White can force Black to play P-Kt3, a weakening move, by P-K5
and Q-Kt4, Black should have played P-Kt3 at once, so as to have
Kt-R4 in answer to P-K5, thus keeping one piece for the defence
of the King's side.  The latter is in jeopardy after the move in
the text, and White's attack succeeds.

          10. P-K5          Kt-Q2
          11. Q-Kt4         P-Kt3
          12. KR-K1         P-QB4

Of course Black must not accept the sacrifice of the exchange by
playing P-Q5. After 13 Kt-K4, BxR; 14 Kt-Q6ch, K-B1; 15 R x B,
Black is in a mating net, from which there is no escape, as he
has no time to collect sufficient forces for the defence. The
move in the text does not stem the tide either, and White quickly
forces the win by a beautiful combination.

          13. P-QR3          B-R4
          14. B-KKt5         Q-Kt3

Q-B2 leads to the same conclusion.

          15. P-Kt4!         PxP
          16. KtxP           PxKt
          17. P-K6

The object of White's fifteenth move is revealed. Without it the
R at K1 would now be attacked.

          17. ...            P-B4

Kt-B4 fails on account of 18. PxPch, KxP; 19. R-K7ch, followed by
Q-KB4.

          2. Kt-QB3        Kt-QB3
          3. P-KKt3

Speedy development by Kt-B3 and P-Q4 is more desirable, as
otherwise Black may have time to get a firm footing at his Q5.

          3. ...           P-KKt3
          4. B-Kt2         B-Kt2

The Black Bishop is the more effective, as the line of the White
Bishop is masked by the KP. Small as this advantage would seem,
it becomes serious later on. It is another confirmation of the
doctrine that the value of each manoeuvre in the opening depends
on the measure of mobility it affords for the pieces.

          5. KKt-K2         Kt-B3
          6. P-Q3

Here White could still obtain a freer game with P-Q4.  Perhaps he
was afraid of losing a pawn after 6. ... PxP; 7. KtxP, KtxP. But
there is nothing in it, e.g. 8. KKtxKt, KtxKt; 9. KtxQ, KtxQ; 10.
KtxBP! (KtxKtP?  BxKt; 11. BxB, R-QKt1), KxKt (KtxBP?; 11. KtxR,
KtxR; 12. KtxP, KtxP; 13. KtxP), KxKt. There was nothing else to
be feared after P-Q4.

          6. ...              P-Q3
          7. Castles          B-Q2

in order to play Q-B1 and B-R6 and to exchange Bishops, after
which there would be weak points at White's KR3 and KB3.

          8. P-KR3             Castles
          9. B-K3              P-KR3

Black also prevents an exchange of Bishops.

         10. Q-Q2              K-R2
         11. P-B4              Kt-K1

The position has now become exceedingly difficult. In order to
make the most of the favourable development of his KB, Black must
advance on the Queen's side. But in moving his King's side pieces
over to the Queen's side, Black must proceed warily, as White
might get chances of an attack with overwhelming forces on the
King's side.

         12. P-KKt4            Kt-B2
         13. Kt-Kt3

Here it was necessary to play R-B2 in order to play the QR to KB1
before Black could manage to drive the Kt to Q1 by P-QKt4-5.

         13. ...               P-QKt4
         14. Kt-Q1?

It would still have been better to play QR-K1 and to leave the
Queen's side to itself as long as possible after P-Kt5, 15. Kt-
Q1, in order to start an assault on the King's side with P-B5, P-
KR4 and P-Kt5. After the text move the Queen's Rook remains shut
in.

         14. ...               QR-Kt1
         15. Kt-K2

in order to play P-B3 and P-Q4. The whole plan, however, is
inconsequent, as he has started an attack on the King's side. Now
he suddenly opens up files on the Queen's side where Black has
assembled superior forces. The result is that White gets into
trouble on both wings, for as soon as he gives up his King's side
attack, the advanced pawns there, as one knows, are only a source
of weakness.

This shuts in the White KB altogether, and at the same time opens
the diagonal of Black's KB. Therefore, on principle alone the
move is questionable. In effect it gives Black an opportunity for
a beautiful winning combination.  Only P-K5 was worth
considering, as then the opposing Bishop would have been shut in
and White's own diagonal opened.

          24. KtxB

Although three minor pieces are generally an equivalent for the
Queen, in this case the White game collapses quickly.  The
advanced pawns have produced too many weak points which afford an
entry for the Black forces.

The aim of this move is to provoke Kt-B3, and incidentally to
prevent P-QB4. The latter move would give White command of his Q5
and not only prevent Black's P-Q4 but also immobilise Black's KP
unless his QP is to remain  "backward."

           5. QKt-B3              P-KKt3

As shown on p. 216, P-Q3 must be played first. In any case Black
must be wary of playing P-KKt3. If, for instance, after P-Q3
White plays 6. B-QB4, and Black replies with P-KKt3, there
follows 7. KtxKt, PxKt; 8. P-K5!, Kt-Kt5 (PxP?, 9. BxPch); 9. P-

White has now three pieces in action and Black none.  Black's
game is hopeless already; his B2 cannot be covered by Q-Q2
because of: 11. BxPch, QxB; 12. QxPch, and after Q-K2ch there
follows: 11. B-K3, B-Kt2; 12. Castles QR, and 13. KR-K1, with an
overwhelming attack.

         10. ...               Q-Q2
         11. Kt-Q5

In view of the fact that his game is so much more developed, and
that the opposing King will hardly be able to escape from the
centre of the board, White decides to sacrifice a Knight in order
to open the files in the centre for his Rooks, instead of
following the simple line indicated in the previous note.

         14. Castles KR

Castles QR is stronger still, as the QR gets into action at once.

or 18. ... Q-B1; 19. BxP, etc.

After 17. R-K1 Black could have held out a little longer with B-
B3. After the text move, however, Black's game collapses quickly
before the concentrated onslaught of the White forces.

           2. PxP              Kt-KB3

This is to tempt White to play P-QB4, a weak move  (see p. 35).
By playing P-QB3 Black would obtain by far the better game in
exchange for the pawn.

           3. P-Q4             QxP

KtxP can also be played. In either case White wins a move by
driving off the Black piece by Kt-QB3 or P-QB4.  Furthermore,
White has a pawn in the centre. Black's plan in retaking with the
Queen might be to castle early on the Queen's side and attack
White's centre pawn by P-K4, and White must be on the alert
against this plan, though it will not be easy for Black to put
the same into execution, because of the exposed position of his
Queen. After 4. Kt-QB3, Q-QR4 is the only move which brings the
Queen into momentary security, and even then Black must provide
for a retreat, as after White's B-Q2 there would be a threat of
an advantageous   "discovery" by the Kt. P-QB3 provides such a
retreat, but it bars the QKt from its natural development at B3,
where the Kt could exert further pressure on White's Q4. The QB,
too, is difficult to get into play and easily becomes an object
of attack, as in the present game.

          4. Kt-QB3          Q-QR4
          5. Kt-B3           B-B4

B-Kt5 would only help White's intentions to attack on the King's
side in the absence of Black's Queen, e.g. 6. P-KR3, B-R4; 7. P-
KKt4, B-Kt3; 8. Kt-K5 (threatening Kt-B4), P-B3; 9. P-KR4, Q Kt-
Q2; 10. Kt-B4, Q-B2; 11. P-R5, B-K5; 12. KtxB, KtxKt; 13. Q-B3

P-B3 was urgent here, to provide against Kt-B4 and Q-B3. Now the
game is as good as lost. White obtains a violent attack with
superior forces, and brings it home before Black has time to
complete his development.

It is better to advance the QP at once and so threaten B-Q2,
after which Black is almost under compulsion to provide a retreat
for his Q by P-QB3, thus blocking his QKt.

Already now the mistake of having allowed Black to develop his
Queen's side unmolested is apparent. P-Q4 is now impossible, for
Black would castle on the Queen's side and keep the initiative by
exerting a permanent pressure on White's QP by P-K4. White must
yield up the centre to Black.

This advance is somewhat purposeless, as the White pieces are not
ready for an attack on Black's King. It is difficult, though, to
find a sensible plan, as the White pieces have so little
mobility. It would perhaps be best to play R-K1, B-B1, and Kt-K4.

The purpose of this move is not clear. The advance of the KtP
could only be condoned by a desire to obtain an open file, and it
seems illogical to protect it now. If White wanted to escape the
pinning of his KKt he need not have moved the Queen. KtxKt would
have effected this and prevented the King's side from being laid
bare.

White's game would still have been bad, particularly as the
exchange at Q4 opens the diagonal for the Black KB, but the move
in the text has even a worse effect. Mieses concludes the game
with an elegant sacrifice.

          8. P-B3                 P-KR4!

A deep conception. If White accepts the proffered sacrifice of a
pawn, he loses time, as he must retire his B before bringing out
his Kt, and, moreover, the KR file being open, he can only castle
on the Q side. But there the Black Queen is ready for the attack.
If he refuses the sacrifice, the text move is still of value, as
even then it is hardly advisable for White to castle on the K
side, whilst Black can play B-R3 as soon as it might be desirable
to exchange White's QB.

Black is the first to complete his development, and he assumes

This is much stronger than the alternative P-QKt3, which would
fatally disturb the pawn skeleton, particularly as castling is
only possible on the Q side. Although Black can now gain two
pawns, White obtains an attack and Black only just manages to
escape with a draw.

Whilst Black was busy capturing two pawns by moving the Queen
four times, White was concentrating the whole of his forces, and
now threatens to win back the pawn with R-Kt4. The move in the
text anticipates the threat, for now the answer to 20. R-Kt4
would be Q-R4; 21. KtxP?, Q-B4ch; 22. Kt-K4?? Kt-Q7ch, winning
the Q.

the favourable position of the White pieces, he prefers to risk
nothing and to avoid the weakening of position which follows upon
practically every pawn move.

For after BxKt there follows 42. Q-K8ch, K-B2; 43. QxBch, with

Both players have shown a deep positional insight, and the game
shows in an interesting manner how a preponderance of material

There seems to be nothing alarming about the position, yet on
closer investigation a number of vital failings can be discerned
in Black's camp. The absence of a pawn in the centre and the
unsatisfactory development have a far-reaching influence.  White
will be able to bring his forces to the King's side by way of K4,
which is made accessible by the disappearance of Black's QP,
before Black has time to bring his QB to bear on White's K4 by P-
QKt3 and B-Kt2. White's immediate threat (after P-K5) is Q-K2-K4
and B-Q3.  If Black does not wish to risk P-KKt3, he must defend
himself with R-K1, Kt-B1. In the meantime White can play R-Q1 and
threaten P-Q5, opening the Queen's file. This again necessitates
P-B3, which postpones the efficiency of the QB at Kt2 until
White's QKt and QR have been brought up for the attack. The game
develops on these lines, and provides an excellent example of the
advantage of the command of the centre.

Black cannot yet play P-QB4, as R-B4 is threatened with an attack
on KB7. The Bishop which obstructs the Q would have no move, save
the sorry retreat to Q1, and White would win speedily: 17. ... P-
QB4; 18. R-B4, B-Q1; 19. P-Q5, PxP; 20. KtxP, BxKt; 21. BxB,
attacking R and P.

         18. R-Kt4          BxKt
         19. PxB            K-R1

QxP was threatened.

         20. Kt-Kt5         R-K2
         21. Kt-K4

Even the Knight is brought in via K4.

         21. ...            R-Q1
         22. R-Q3           P-QB4
         23. Kt-B6

threatening QxPch and R-Kt8 mate. Black cannot capture the Kt
because of QxPch and mate at Kt7. But the mate cannot be delayed
much longer in view of the concentration of superior forces for
the attack.

         23. ...              Kt-Kt3
         24. R-R3             Resigns

There is no answer to Q-Kt5 and RxP.

                Diag. 150

Lasker has played this move successfully in his match against
Marshall; but it has not come into general use. White should get
the better game by 6. BxB, QxB; 7. Q-B2, KtxKt; 8. QxKt or 7.
PxP, KtxKt; 8. PxKt, PxP; 9. Q-Kt3, in the first case because the
Black QB is out of play, in the second case because of the open
Kt file. 7. KtxKt is bad, because PxKt prevents the natural
development of the KKt at B3, and Black can obtain an attack
after castling by P-KB4-5.

          6. BxB           QxB
          7. B-Q3

This also is a good move, as it furthers development.

          7. ...           KtxKt
          8. PxKt          PxP

Giving up the centre pawn in this case is not against the spirit
of the opening, as it opens the only diagonal on which the Black
QB can operate.

         12. Castles KR    Castles
         13. P-QR4

This move can only be good if White intends to operate on the
Queen's side, possibly by KR-Kt1 and P-R5.  But the position of
the White Queen makes the adoption of a different plan
compulsory. For one thing, it is rational to concentrate forces
where the Queen can take her share, therefore, in this case, on
the King's side. On the other hand, the manoeuvre referred to
could not be put into execution here because Black can prevent P-
R5 by P-QB4 and Kt-B3. A fairly obvious course was to play P-K4,
taking possession of the centre. P-QB4 would then be answered by
P-Q5, after which the White Rooks would be very effective at Q1
and K1. In this game White does initiate a King's side attack
subsequently, and thus 13. ... P-QR4 is clearly a lost move.

          13. ...          P-QB4
          14. Q-Kt3        Kt-B3
          15. Kt-B4        QR-B1

The tempting move of P-K4 cannot be played because of 16. Kt-Q5,
Q-Q1; 17. PxBP, Kt-R4; 18. KR-Q1.  The move in the text threatens
PxP, KtxP and RxB.

          16. B-R2         KR-Q1
          17. KR-K1        Kt-R4

This threatens B-B3 attacking the RP. White decides to yield the
same at once, thinking quite rightly that a direct attack must
have good chances, as Black gets two pieces out of play in
capturing the pawn.

         18. QR-Q1           B-B 3
         19. Q-Kt4

Black cannot take the pawn yet, because of KtxP and BxPch.

         20. P-Q5?

                Diag. 151

There is no need to play for violent complications. The logical
course was to open the way to the King's side for the Rooks by P-
K4. The continuation could have been:  20. P-K4, BxRP; 21. Kt-R5,
P-Kt3; 22. P-K5, BxR; 23. RxB followed by Kt-B6, with a strong
attack; also after 21. ... P-B3, 22. R-Q2, White's attacking
chances are good. After the move in the text, Black could get an
advantage by simply exchanging: 20. ... PxP; 21. KtxP, BxKt; 22.
RxB, RxR; 23. QxRch, R-Q1; 24. Q-KB5, P-Kt3; 25. Q-B2, Q-R6. In
taking the RP, however, Black incurs grave risks.

         20. ...             BxRP
         21. R-Q2            P-K4
         22. Kt-R5           P-Kt3
         23. P-Q6            Q-K3
         24. Q-Kt5           K-R1

Black finds the weaknesses at his KB3 and KR3 very troublesome.
RxP would lose at once, because of 25. RxR, QxR; 26. Q-R6!

          25. Kt-B6           RxP
          26. RxR             QxR
          27. B-Kt1

Q-R4 would have been answered by K-Kt2.

          27. ...             Kt-B3

Black must try to bring back his minor pieces for the defence. If
he succeeds in doing that in time, the end-game is easily won on
the Queen's side.

          28. B-B5            R-Q1

Not PxB because of Q-R6.

          29. P-KR4

White's attacking resources seem inexhaustible. By exchanging
Queens he could have got his pawn back in this way:  29. B-Q7, Q-
B1 (R xB?, 30. Q-R6); 30. BxKt, BxB; 31. QxQP, Q-Q3; 32. Kt-
Q7,QxQ; 33. KtxQ, B-K1; 34. KtxQBP. But even then Black would
maintain a superiority in the end-game owing to the freedom of
his passed pawn, and because he can post his Rook at the seventh
after P-QKt4. This explains why Marshall prefers not to win back
his pawn, but to enter upon a violent attack with a doubtful
issue. However, Capablanca finds the right move in all the
ensuing complications, and finally wins the game.

This is now compulsory. If White loses time in withdrawing the B,
Black consolidates his position by: Kt-Q4 and Q-K2.

R-B1 is refuted by 33. Kt-Kt5!, PxB; 34. QxR, etc.

Better than Kt-Kt5, for after Kt-Q4, 34. QxPch, the Black King
finds a safe retreat at Kt2.

         39. P-R6ch              K-R1

KtxP fails on account of Q-B6ch.

         40. Q-Q6

White takes all possible advantage from the position, but cannot
bring home his attack, as Black has concentrated his forces for
the defence. Black must still be careful to avoid a mate, e.g.
QxQ?; 41. PxQ, RxP; 42. R-B7 or 4l. ... R-Q2; 42. R-B8.

         40. ...                 Q-B4
         41. Q-Q4

Here White could have tried QxQ and R-B8. There was then a
permanent threat of RxB, e.g. 41. QxQ, PxQ; 42. R-B8, RxP; 43.
Kt-B3, R-K2; 44. Kt-Kt5, etc.  It seems as if Black would have to
give up the piece again by 43. ... R-R4 in order to win. White,
however, would then have drawing chances, which would have been a
fitting conclusion to this wonderful game.

Capablanca tried 5. ... B-Kt5; against Ed. Lasker in New York,
1915. The continuation was: 6. P-K3, P-B4; 7. B-Q3, Q-R4; 8. Q-
Kt3.

The correct move is here 8. Castles. If Black wins the pawn by
BxKt; 9. PxB, QPxP; 10. BxP, QxBP, White obtains a strong attack,
e.g., 11. R-B1, Q-R4; 12. BxKt, PxB (KtxB; 13. PxP); 13. P-Q5,
with this possible continuation l3. ... Kt-Kt3, 14. PxP, PxP; 15.

          7. Q-B2               P-B4

White intends to castle on the Queen's side, and to follow this
up with a storm by the King's side pawns. Although Rubinstein has
on many occasions been successful with this form of attack, it is
open to criticism. For, where Kings have castled on different
wings, the attack on the King which has castled on the Q side
should be more successful.

                Diag. 153

This is much stronger than P-Q Kt3 and B-Kt2, as then the Black
Queen cannot participate in the attack quickly enough. As pointed
out before, speed is the first consideration for the attack,
whenever the Kings have castled on different wings. An
interesting counterpart to the present game is found in a game
won by Rubinstein from Teichmann (Match, Vienna, 1908) 7. ... P-
QKt3; 8. PxP, PxP; 9. B-Q3, B-Kt2; 10. Castles QR, P-B4; 11. P-
KR4, P-B5?  (the only hope lay in the opening of the QB file);
12. B-B5, R-K1; 13. BxKKt, KtxB; 14. P-KKt4, B-Q3; 15. P-Kt5, Kt-
K5; 16. P-R5, Q-K2; 17. QR-Kt1, P-QR3; 18. BxPch!, KxB; 19. P-
Kt6ch, K-Kt1; 20. KtxKt, PxKt; 21. P-R6, P-B31 22. PxP, PxKt; 23
R-R8ch, KxP; 24. R-R7ch, and Black resigned a few moves later.

          8. Castles           Q-R4
          9. PxQP

White loses time in the centre. It was imperative to proceed at
once with P-KKt4 followed by BxKt, P-Kt5 and P-KR4.

          9. ...               KPxP
         10. PxP               KtxP
         11. Kt-Q4             B-K3
         12. K-Kt1

It would be too risky to leave both King and Queen on the QB
file.

         12. ...               QR-B1
         13. B-Q3              P-KR3

The threat was: BxKt and BxPch. Had White played P-KKt4 and P-KR4
instead of effecting exchanges in the centre, Black would not
have been able to afford this weakening move. But now Black wins
the game on the other wing, before White is able to make use of
the weakness thus created.

         14. BxKt              BxB
         15. B-B5              KR-Q1
         16. BxB               PxB
         17. Q-Kt6

The Queen must leave the QB file without delay, as Kt-K5 is
threatened. Black's game is already superior; with the exception
of the Queen, White has no piece available for the attack on the
opposing King.

          17. ...                 R-Q3
          18. R-QB1               R-R3

Now White must again provide against Black's Kt-K5, as White's
QKt is needed for the defence of QR2.

          19. P-B3                R-Q1

Black intends to move his B and then to advance his KP with an
attack on the Queen. The object of the text move is to prevent
White from saving himself by an attack on the Rook (Q-B5).

          20. R-B2                BxKt

By this exchange Black achieves his object of driving off the
Knight by P-Q5, but White has time to give his RP further
protection by P-QKt3, This, Black would have prevented by playing
B-Kt4 instead of the text move, e.g. 21. P-B4, P-K4; 22. Q-B5,
PxKt; 23. PxP, B-B3; 24. PxKt, P-Q5, etc.

          21. PxB                  P-K4
          22. Q-Kt4                PxP
          23. QxP                  Kt-K3
          24. Q-K5

This delays the fatal advance of the QP for one move.

                Diag. 154

Black does not play for a draw, but only wishes to gain time.

          33. ...            R-QB3

The intention is to double Rooks and to force an entry at B7. P-
Kt5 would not be good. The White Rook would no longer be
attacked, and the Knight could attack the QP.

          34. R(B1)-Q1       KR-QB1

Now that the White Rook has left the QB file, one Rook would be
sufficient to force an entry at B7, and Kt-R6ch followed by P-Kt5
could have been played at once, e.g. 34. ... Kt-R6ch; 35. K-R1,
P-Kt5 (preventing P-QKt4); 36. Kt-B2,R-B7; 37. RxR, PxR; 38. R-
QB1, Q-Kt3; 39. Kt-K4, R-Q8 followed by RxRch, Q-Q5ch and P-B8
mate.

          35. RxP            Kt-R6ch
          36. K-R1           P-Kt5
          37. R-Q7           Q-K4!!

If QxQ, Black mates in three.

          38. R-Q8ch        RxR
          39. RxRch         K-R2
          40. R-Q1          QxQch

Curiously enough there is nothing better. Q-B2 only leads to the
exchange of Queens and the same end-game, which, however, is an
easy win for Black, as the permanent mating threat keeps the
White Rook tied to the first rank, whilst the Black King
threatens to capture all the White pawns.

If Q-B2 White forces the exchange of Queens with the following
combination: 41. Q-Q2, R-B7; 42. Q-Q3, R-B8ch; 43. K-Kt2, with a
threat of Kt-B6ch and Q-R7 mate. Black therefore would have to
play Q-B7ch, etc., as in the game.

         41. KxQ           R-B7ch
         42. K-R1          RxP
         43. R-R1          P-Kt4
         44. Kt-B6ch       K-Kt2
         45. Kt-K4         K-Kt3
         46. Kt-Q6         P-QR4

We have now a position with a forced move. If the White Knight
moves, there follows K-B4-B5, etc. Therefore White gives up his R
P voluntarily.

         47. R-QB1         RxP
         48. Kt-B4         Kt-Kt4

Now Kt-B6 and RxP mate are threatened.

         49. Kt-K5ch       K-Kt2
         50. Kt-Kt4        R-K7
         51. R-B5          R-K8ch
         52. K-Kt2         Kt-R6
         53. R-B7ch        K-B1
         54. R-B1          R-K7ch
         55. K-R1          Kt-B7ch
         56. K-Kt1         Kt-R6ch

Black again appears to be short of time.

         57. K-R1          Kt-Kt4
         58. R-B5          R-K8ch
         59. K-Kt2         Kt-R6
         60. R-B1          R-K7ch

Now, after the sixtieth move Black has again plenty of time, and
can prepare the final combination at leisure.

         61. K-R1          R-K3
         62. R-R1          K-Kt2

         68. Kt-K2         Kt-B7ch
         69. K-Kt2         Kt-Q5

         10. Q-Q2

White cannot win the QP by 10. PxP, PxP; 11. KtxP, KtxKt; 12.
QxKt, because BxPch wins the Queen.  The text move is played with
the intention of bringing up the QR for the attack on the QP.
However, it would have been more correct to fix the object of
attack first by PxP, as Black could now cross White's intentions
by playing PxP, after which he would sooner or later gain a move
by occupying the Q file with a Rook, and forcing the White Queen
to retreat.

         10. ...                 Q-K2!

Black offers to give up his Queen's Pawn. If White accepts the
sacrifice, Black's attack on the Queen's file will become deadly,
as White must lose a move in bringing his Queen out of the line
of action of the hostile Rook. The White King has then no time to
get into safety, e.g. 11. PxP, PxP; 12. KtxP, KtxKt; 13. QxKt, R-
Q1; 14. Q-Kt3, B-K3 followed by KtxP, etc.

         11. B-Q3?

Here again PxP (followed by B-K2, R-Q1, Castles)  would have
avoided the loss of a move, as indicated in my note to move 10.
Now White loses yet another move, as Black exchanges pawns and
the Bishop has taken two moves to reach B4, as against one only
in the case of the Black KB.  The loss of two moves in the
opening stages should be fatal, and of this Rubinstein gives a
striking example in the present game.

         11. ...                 PxP
         12. BxP                 P-QKt4

         14. Q-K2                B-Kt2
         15. Castles KR          Kt-K4

The advantage which Black obtains by his last move is generally
gained by White in this opening (compare Diag. 36).  But in the
game White has lost two moves and Black has assumed the
offensive, having moreover a Rook acting on the Q file.

         16. KtxKt               BxKt
         17. P-B4

Black's threat was: BxPch followed by Q-Q3ch and QxB. If White
replies: 17. KR-Q1 the answer is Q-B2 attacking both the RP and
the Kt. The text move is unsatisfactory, as it will be necessary
to advance the KP to K4 or K5, where it will block the diagonal
of one of the Bishops.

This move is not satisfactory at this juncture. It rather helps a

the KP by the White KB on the diagonal KR3-QB8. 8. ... Kt-B3

which White could hardly be said to possess any advantage, e.g.
9. B-Kt5, Kt-K5, or 9. B-K3, Kt-KKt5, or 9. P-QR3, or 9. PxP,
BxP; 10. B-Kt5, B-K2. After 9. PxP, however, it would be weak to
recapture with the Queen. In a game E. Cohn-Ed. Lasker (match
1909) there followed: 9. ... Q-R4; 10. Kt-KKt5, QxP; 11. B-K3, Q-
R4; 12.  Q-Kt3, after which Black had to give up a pawn already:
Castles QR; 13. KtxB, PxKt; 14. B-R3, etc.

         10. Kt-KKt5       Kt-B3

         12. B-R3          Q-K2
         13. B-Kt5

P-K4 is stronger here, in order to play B-Kt5 after PxP. l3. ...
P-Q5 would then be refuted by Kt-Q5.

         13. ...           Castles
         14. BxKt          QxB

After this White gains a pawn by a complicated and well-timed
combination. Capablanca did not consider the subtle reply on
Rubinstein's seventeenth move. Otherwise he would have recaptured
with the pawn. However, in that case too, White's chances are
good in the end-game which ensues after:  15. KtxP, PxKt; 16.
QxPch, K-R1; 17. BxR. The Rooks would soon become effective in
view of the open K side.

BxPch fails because of 16. K-Kt2, Q-B2; 17. Kt-B4!

                Diag. 158

         17. ...                 PxKt

If RxKt, White exchanges Queens and plays BxPch.

         18. QxB                 Q-Q7
         19. Q-Kt5               Kt-Q5
         20. Q-Q3

With an extra pawn White forces the exchange of Queens.  Black
cannot prevent it, as 20. ... QxKtP loses the Knight on account
of 21. KR-Kt1, and 20. ... Q-Kt5 loses the QP by 21. KR-Q1 and B-
K6ch.

         20. ...                 QxQ
         21. PxQ                 KR-K1
         22. B-Kt4

KR-K1 would not prevent the entry of the Black Rook:  Kt-B7; 23.
RxRch, RxR; 24. R-QB1, R-K7; 25. B-Kt4, R-Q7. Black would win the
pawn back and might even succeed in the end-game with a Knight
against a Bishop.

         22. ...                 R-Q3
         23. KR-K1               RxR
         24. RxR                 R-QKt3

Black should first play his King to KB3, and keep the Rook away
from his K5. Not that the QP is of paramount importance; the QKtP
fully makes up for its loss. But as played the Knight is driven
from his dominating position, and the badly placed Bishop gets
into play. No doubt even after the text move the ending is most
difficult, and it requires Rubinstein's full powers to bring it
to a successful issue.

          25. R-K5               RxP
          26. RxP                Kt-B3

          30. B-B4               P-QR3

Black's only chance is his extra pawn on the Q side. To exchange
the Kt for the B by 30. ... K-Q3; 31. R-B 7, Kt-K4; 32. RxKKtP,
KtxB would take too much time where time is all-important. White
would clear the K side in the meantime, push on his KRP, and
ultimately give up his R for Black's remaining P, as soon as the
latter runs into Queen, after which the three passed pawns win
easily against the Rook. Generally speaking it is wise, in R
endings like the present one, to advance pawns on the side where
there is an extra pawn, in order to get a passed pawn as soon as
possible.  Then the hostile Rook has to look after that pawn lest
it should queen, and the greater mobility of one's own Rook often
saves the game even when opposed by a preponderance of pawns.

         31. R-B7ch             K-Q3
         32. RxKKtP             P-Kt4

         38. B-Q5               P-Kt6

RxP is tempting but unavailing, as White plays B-B4 followed by
R-Kt5ch and P-R5-6, etc. After the text move White has a problem-
like continuation, which he has worked out with great accuracy.

         39. PxP                P-R6
         40. BxKt

If now P-R7, White simply plays 41. R-Kt5ch, K-R3; 42. R-Kt8-R8.

As the R holds the RP, e.g. K-R4; 43. B-B4 followed by R-R6ch or

    White: Niemzowitsch.   Black: Tarrasch.

            Queen's Gambit Declined.

          1. P-Q4                P-Q4
          2. Kt-KB3              P-QB4
          3. P-B4                P-K3

         10. R-B1                Q-K2
         11. PxQP

The most natural move to which the development of the QKt at Q2
instead of B3 would seem to lead is Kt-K5 followed by P-B4. After
11. Kt-K5 Black could not yet attempt 11. ... PxQP; 12. KPxP, B-
R6, weakening the QP, because of 13. BxB, QxB; 14. PxP, KtxKt;
15.  PxKt, KtxP; 16. Kt-B4 and Kt-Q6.

         11. ...             KPxP
         12. Kt-R4

In order to provoke Black's weakening move: P-Kt3, which might
give White chances of attack on the long diagonal QR1-KR8, White
gives up two clear moves. Black is able to get considerably ahead
in his development, much to White's disadvantage.

         12. ...             P-Kt3
         13. KKt-B3          QR-Q sq

Not Kt-K5 yet, on account of 14. PxP, PxP?; 15. BxKt, PxB; 16.
KtxP.

         14. PxP

White's position is uncomfortable, and a satisfactory
continuation is hard to find. Possibly passive resistance might
have been the best plan, thus: Q-K2, KR-Q1, Kt-B1-Kt3.   The text
move is a preliminary to operations on the Queen's side, but
allows Black too much scope in the centre.

         14. ...             PxP
         15. B-Kt5

White wishes to get rid of the Black Knight which supports the
advance of P-Q5.

          15. ...           Kt-K5
          16. BxKt          BxB
          17. Q-B2

White has no idea of the threatened disaster, or he would have
played P-KKt3. Even then, however, Black has the better game with
two Bishops, and the Q and Kt better placed.

          17. ...           KtxKt

The beginning of a brilliant mating combination.

          18. KtxKt          P-Q5!

Black would have played the same move if White had retaken with
the Queen.

          19. PxP

P-K4 was comparatively the best move, although Black's attack
would have become overwhelming after P-B4, e.g. 20. P-B3, B-B5,
etc.

Emanuel Lasker won a celebrated game from Bauer   (Amsterdam,

this is the reason why Tarrasch's beautiful game only earned him
the second brilliancy prize at Petrograd (1914).

                Diag. 160

Black's difficulty is the development of his QB, particularly
after White's last move, which prevents P-K4. If now Q-B2 White
plays 9. P-K4 and either the Queen or the Knight bear on K5, e.g.
9. ... PxKP; 10. KtxP, P-K4; 11. QKt-Kt5, B-Q3; 12. P-B5, etc.

Black therefore must develop his QB at Kt2 with P-QKt3, B-Kt2 and
P-B4. Having moved the QBP twice, Black is a move behind the
development usual in this opening.  However, it would have been
the lesser evil. In the present game the Bishop does not get into
play in time.

          8. ...          PxP
          9. KtxP         P-B4
         10. QKt-K5       PxP
         11. PxP          Kt-Kt3
         12. Kt-Kt5

If Black captures the pawn, White gains time by threatening the
Queen, and brings all his forces into play, whilst the Black
Queen's side remains undeveloped, e.g.: 12. ... QxP; 13.   R-Q1,
Q-B4; 14. Kt-Kt4, P-Kt3; 15. B-K3, Q-R4; 16. R-B1, with a strong
attack. Black of course need not take the pawn, but the move in
the text is a valuable one nevertheless, as the threat Q-B3-R3
provokes a weakening pawn move.

          12. ...       P-Kt3
          13. KKt-B3    K-Kt2

preventing the entry of the B at R6.

          14. B-KKt5    QKt-Q4
          15. QR-B1     B-Q2
          16. Q-Q2      Kt-Kt1

It should be noted how the weakness at KR3 acts to the detriment
of Black's game. The text move covers the weak square, but at the
same time brings the Kt out of play. White in consequence gets
the upper-hand on the Queen's side, and the Knight cannot return
in time.

          17. BxB       QxB

It would be no use taking with the KKt, as the threat Kt-Kt4 and
Q-R6 must be guarded against. If the other Kt captures there
follows: 18. B-K4, R-Kt1; 19. R-B3 and KR-B1.

          18. B-K4      B-Kt4

This drives the Rook to a better square, but already now there is
no satisfactory move. It would perhaps have been best to parry
the threat of BxKt and R-B7 by playing Q-Q3, although the pawn
would have to recapture after 19. BxKt, because of 20. R-B5 and
KR-B1. The chance of bearing on the QP through the open file,
which was probably Black's intention all along, would then be
lost. After the text move, however, White takes possession of the
seventh rank, and Black's game collapses quickly.

           19. KR-K1    Q-Q3
           20. BxKt     PxB
           21. Q-R5     P-QR3

Before initiating this manoeuvre, which aims at the development
of the Queen's wing, Black should castle, as otherwise the King
is exposed to dangerous and immediate attacks in the centre.

          8. BxBP      P-Kt4
          9. B-Q3      P-QR3

The system of opening chosen by Black has been tried frequently
of late. It seems to be somewhat artificial, as the QB Pawn takes
two moves to get to his fourth. On the other hand the pawn
formation at QR3, QKt4, and QB4 is attained, whilst it can be
prevented in other variations, e.g. 6. ... Castles; 7. B-Q3, PxP;
8. BxP, P-QR3; 9 P-QR4.

                Diag. 161

Black's only plausible move here seems to be P-B4, and many
critics have remarked that after 11. P-K5, PxP!; 12. Kt-K4 (if
PxKt, PxKt) KtxKt; 13. BxKt, R-QKt1; 14. BxB, QxB; 15. QxP, Q-B4;
the game would have been even. However, this is not the case, for
on the 15th move White does not capture the pawn with the Q but
with the Kt and Black has no satisfactory continuation. If he had
castled he could play l5. ... B-Kt2 which now is not available
because of: 16. Kt-B6, BxKt; 17. BxB, with an overwhelming
advantage in position for White. White's refutation of the text
move is above criticism.

          11. PxP       Kt-Kt5
          12. B-KB4     B-B4

If Q-B2, White would play R-B1, after which Black could not
recapture the KP yet, as the QBP is en prise.  13. ... KKtxP; 14.
KtxKt, KtxKt; 15. Kt-Q5, Q-Q3; 16. BxKt, QxB; 19. RxP, etc.

          13. Castles   Q-B2
          14. R-B1      P-B3

Again KtxP is not feasible on account of the loss of the QBP, as
can be easily seen.

          15. B-Kt3     PxP

Black's game cannot be saved. If l5. ... Kt(Kt5)xKP there follows
16. KtxKt, KtxKt; 17. Kt-Q5, Q-Q3; 18. BxKt, PxB; 19. RxB, or 16.
... PxKt; 17. Q-R5ch, P-Kt3, 18. Q-R6.

          16. P-Kt4!

Now White initiates a brilliant attack, driving it home without
giving Black a moment's rest. If Black takes the pawn, White
plays Kt-Q4, with many threats, e.g. P-B4; 18. Kt-Q5, Q-Q3; 19.
Kt-K6, or l7. ... Kt(Kt5)-B3; 18. Kt-K6, etc.

          16. ...       B-R2
          17. BxKtP

The sacrifice is fairly obvious, as White obtains three pawns for
the piece, and moreover drives the King into the field of battle.
However, this does not detract from the beauty of the game, which
is full of brilliant phases.

          17. ...        RPxB
          18. KtxKtP     Q-Q1

Or Q-Kt3; 19. Kt-Q6ch, K-K2; 20. Kt-B5ch, followed by Q-Q6.

          19. Kt-Q6ch    K-B1
          20. RxP        Kt-Kt3

The threat was: 21. Q-Q5, Kt-R3; 22. KtxB, RxKt; 23. R-Q6, etc.
20. ... Kt(Q2)-B3 is of no avail because of 21. Q-Kt3, Kt-R3; 22.
KtxP, or 21. ... Q-Q2; 22. KR-B1, etc.

          21. B-R4       Q-Q2
          22. KtxB!      QxR

Not RxKt because of 23. QxQ. Now Black is a whole Rook ahead. But
it is as much out of play as his Queen's side pieces. The King is
driven into a mating net by the concentration of superior White
forces, and only escapes by giving up the extra piece.

          23. Q-Q8ch     Q-K1
          24. B-K7ch     K-B2
          25. Kt-Q6ch    K-Kt3

If K-R3 there follows mate in three by 27. Kt(Q6)-B5ch; 28. Kt-

          27. KtxQ          RxQ

This threatens 31. PxKtch, KxP; 32. P-B3ch, followed by P-Kt3 or
Kt4 mate. If Black plays 30. QR-KKt1, White wins as follows: 31.
PxKtch, RxP; 32. P-B3, Kt-B1ch; 33. K-R2, KtxB; 34. PxRch, KxP;

We have seen on page 55 that Black can hardly develop his QB
without disadvantage. White, however, has no difficulty in doing
so, as his QP is protected, and after Black's Q-Kt3 he has only
to look after his KtP. He could play Q-B1, which might bring the
Q into effective action on the diagonal to R6.

The aim of the text move is the early occupation of K5.  But, as
the present game shows, this cannot be effected. Black must not
waste time with Q-Kt3, but play B-Q3 at once.

Now White has no means of maintaining his centre. Whether he
supports the pawn with Kt-B3 or P-KB4, Black forces matters with
P-B3.

                Diag. 162

Now that the idea underlying White's opening strategy has proved
impracticable, he has difficulty in formulating a plan. Making
the best of a bad job, he abandons his KP in exchange for Black's
KRP. But Black obtains a powerful pawn centre, a telling
advantage.

          14. QxKt          P-B3
          15. Q-R5          Q-Kt3

Black wishes to provoke the advance of the QKtP and QBP in order
to obtain a passed pawn (16. P-QKt3, P-K4; 17. Castles KR, Q-R4;
18. P-QB4, P-Q5). In order to avoid this continuation, White
takes his chance of castling on the Queen's side. This turns out
to Black's advantage. Indeed it is a foregone conclusion. In the
ensuing double assault by pawns, Black is several moves ahead, as
the White pawns concerned in the attack are still on their
original squares.

play with the gain of a move.

          23. Q-Kt3          QR-K7

KR-Kt1 would also be of no avail because of Q-KR3, 25. Q-Q3, Q-
KB3 threatening B-B4. The move in the text puts an end to the
agony.

                 GAME No. 45

   White: Rubinstein.    Black: Spielmann.

           Irregular Opening.

          1. P-Q4          P-QB4

With this move Black tries to avoid well-trodden paths of
tournament practice. White can, at will, lead into a peaceful
Queen's Gambit by 2. P-K3 or into a Sicilian Defence by P-K4. It
is more usual, however, to play P-Q5, which blocks up the Black
centre to some extent.

If 2. PxP, Black regains his pawn after P-K3 without any
disadvantage.

          2. P-Q5          P-Q3
          3. P-QB4

Coupled with 4. P-K4, this move is of doubtful value, as Black
gains command of White's Q4. It is advisable to keep the QBP
back, thus retaining the option of driving off a hostile piece
from Q4 by P-QB3. Moreover, the White KB is hemmed in by the pawn
at QB4.

           3. ...       P-KKt3
           4. P-K4      B-Kt2
           5. B-Q3      P-K3

The development of the KKt is not desirable at B3, where it would
block the long diagonal. From K2, however, it commands KB4, where
it can take up a strong position after the exchange of pawns in
the centre, or else it can support the advance of the KBP.

           6. Kt-QB3    Kt-K2
           7. KKt-K2

Kt-B3 would have been slightly better, because the Black QKt
might play to his K4.

           7. ...       PxP
           8. KPxP      Kt-Q2
           9. P-B4

This move weakens the King's position, and would be justified
only if there was a possibility of opening the file for the Rook
by P-B5. But Black has too strong a hold on his KB4. The text
move aims at preventing the exchange of White's KB through
Black's Kt-K4. It would have been better to withdraw the B to B2.

           9. ...       Kt-KB3
          10. Kt-Kt3    P-KR4!

Now White cannot enforce P-B5, as Black can attack the Knight by
P-R5. White cannot prevent this with P-KR4, as the Black Knight
would take up a commanding position at Kt5. Black's game is
superior. He can concentrate all his minor pieces on the King's
wing, while White's QB is ineffective on account of the ill-
considered advance of the KBP.

          12. KKt-K4     KtxKt
          13. BxKt

White has to capture with the B, in order to exchange the Black
Knight if it should play to B4. After 13. KtxKt, B-Q5ch; 14. K-
R1, Kt-B4; White's Knight would not be able to move from K4 on
account of the threat: Kt-Kt6ch.   Sooner or later, Black would
get a deciding advantage by enforcing the exchange of White's
Knight, e.g. 15. Q-K1, Q-K2; 16. R-QKt1, B-Q2; 17. P-QKt3,
Castles QR; 18. B-Kt2, QxKt; 19. BxQ, Kt-Kt6ch; 20. QxKt, PxQ;
21. P-KR3, BxP; 22. PxB, RxPch; 23. K-Kt2, R-R7ch; 24. KxP, RxB;

White is helpless against the two powerful Bishops.

          16. R-K1ch    K-B1

Black forfeits his chance of castling, not a great loss under the
circumstances. In any case his KR is needed on the Rook's file,
and Black would only have castled on the Queen's side if at all.

          17. Q-B3

Here P-KR3 was essential in order to prevent the further advance
of the KRP. The weakness at Kt3 would not have been so serious in
the absence of a Black Knight. Now Black forces the advance of
White's KKtP, and the Bishops become immediately effective.

If Q-Q3, Black plays Q-B4 and White cannot exchange Queens
because of B-B6 mate.

          21. QR-B1     K-Kt2

Black must not exchange his valuable Bishop.

          23. P-Kt3     KR-K1
          24. B-B2

There is no answer to Black's threat of doubling the Rooks on the
K file. If White plays Q-B2, Black's Queen effects an entry at
Q6, after which he would double his Rooks, and White's Bishop
cannot be defended. After the text move, Black forces the
exchange of his two Rooks for the Queen. Generally speaking, this
is no disadvantage, but in consequence of the exposed position of
the White King, it means a speedy loss for White.

           4. Kt-QB3    B-Kt2
           5. B-Q2

This is not necessary. Black could hardly exchange his B for the
Kt; the weakness at his KB3 and KR3 would become too serious a
disadvantage.

           5. ...       P-K3
           6. P-K4      PxP
           7. KtxP!

In view of the fact that Black's position after BP or KPxP would
be very promising, as all his pieces would be easy to bring into
play, White decides upon the sacrifice of a pawn, in order to
further his own development.

                Diag. 164

Kt-K2 should have been played here in order to play BxB; 17. QxB,
B-Kt5 with Kt-B4, in answer to 16. Q-Kt2.   Black is still open
to attack in consequence of his broken King's side, but there is
no demonstrable advantage for White. The text move is a mistake,
and gives White chances of a decisive attack.

          16. KtxKt         BxKt
          17. BxB           PxB
          18. BxP!          Q-Kt4

Of course not PxB, on account of 19. QxPch, K-R1; 20. QxPch, K-
Kt1; 21. R-Kt3, etc. 18. ... P-B4 fails because of 19. R-Kt3.

          19. B-K4          P-B4
          20. P-B4!!

This elegant continuation decides the game. If PxP, White simply
plays 21. B-Q3, and Black can hardly hope to save the end-game,
as his pawns are broken up. If the Queen retreats, however, there
follows: 21. PxP, and White obtains two passed pawns for the B
and has the superior position.

                GAME No. 47

     White: Tartakower.    Black: Asztalos.

               Dutch Opening.

          1. P-KB4          P-Q4

It has been tried to refute White's non-developing first move by
a pawn sacrifice: 1. ... P-K4; which leads to a rapid
mobilisation of the Black forces after 2. PxP, P-Q3; 3. PxP, BxP.
But this attack--called the From Gambit--does not seem to prevail
against the best defence. In a match game, Tartakower-Spielmann
(Vienna, 1913), White won as follows:

4. Kt-KB3, P-KKt4; 5. P-Q4, P-Kt5; 6. Kt-K5, Kt-QB3; 7. KtxKt,
PxKt; 8. P-KKt3, P-KR4; 9. B-Kt2, P-R5; 10. Q-Q3, B-Q2; 11. Kt-
B3, R-Kt1; 12. Castles, PxP; 13. PxP, P-QB4; 14. B-B4, BxB; 15.
RxB, Q-Kt4; 16. Kt-K4, Q-R3; 17. KtxP, Kt-B3; 18. KtxB, KtxKt;
19. Q-K4ch, K-Q1; 20. RxBP, R-K1; 21. QxP, Q-K6ch; 22. K-B1,
Resigns.

When Black plays P-KB4 in answer to 1. P-Q4 we have the Dutch
Defence. After 1. P-Q4, P-KB4, White can also sacrifice a pawn by
2. P-K4, and thereby obtain a far more favourable position than
Black does in From's gambit, as he is a move to the good, having
already advanced his QP, e.g. 2. P-K4, PxP; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4.
P-B3 or 4. B-Kt5 and then P-B3. If Black captures the KBP, White
obtains a powerful attack. A drastic example is found in the
following little game, played by two students in an academic
tournament at Petrograd: 4. P-B3, PxP; 5. KtxP, P-K3; 6. B-KKt5,
B-K2; 7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. Castles, P-QKt3; 9. Kt-K5, B-Kt2; 10.
BxKt, BxB; 11. BxPch, KxB; 12. Q-R5ch, K-Kt1; 13. Kt-Kt6, R-K1;
14. Q-R8ch, K-B2; 15. Kt-K5ch, K-K2; 16. QxPch!!, BxQ; 17. R-
B7ch, K-Q3; 18. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Q4; 19. P-B4ch, K-K5; 20. R-K1 mate.

Black's best answer is to play P-Q4 after White's 4. P-KB3  (5.
B-Kt5, B-B4). If 4. B-Kt5, it is not yet possible to play P-Q4
because of the threat: BxKt, Q-R5ch, and QxQP. In that case Black
must first play P-QB3, after which White again obtains a strong
attack by P-KB3.

Black can avoid the attacks which follow after 1. P-Q4, P-KB4; 2.
P-K4, by playing P-K3 on his first move, and then lead into the
Dutch defence with P-KB4 on his second move. He must, however,
reckon with having to play the French defence which White can
bring about with 2. P-K4.

          2. P-K3          P-K3
          3. Kt-KB3        P-QB4
          4. P-QKt3        Kt-QB3
          5. B-Kt5         Kt-B3

Black should have played B-Q2 here, as White can exchange at B6,
leaving Black with a doubled pawn. This in itself is not a
drawback, but in the present position it is serious, as Black
will have difficulty in finding a place for his QB. For there is
no prospect of enforcing P-K4, as White commands that square in
sufficient force.

          6. B-Kt2          B-K2
          7. Castles        Castles
          8. BxQKt          PxB
          9. Kt-K5          Q-B2
         10. P-Q3           P-QR4

Black's attempt of capturing his K4 by playing Kt-Q2 and P-B3,
White would cross at once with Q-Kt4. With the text move Black
begins operations on the Q side, which is quite correct, as White
has the upper hand on the other wing.

          11. Q-K2

White should have prevented the further advance of the Black RP
by 11. P-QR4. This would have been sound policy in any case, as
the R file could not have been forced open for the Black Rooks.

          11. ...          P-R5
          12. Kt-Q2        PxP

Premature. The capture is only of value if the file can be held.
To that end it is first necessary to play B-Kt2 and to occupy the
R file with Rooks and Queen. After the exchange
 of Rooks, Black is at a disadvantage for the end-game because of
the inefficiency of the QB.

If instead of the text move Black had driven off the Bishop to B1
with P-R6 (13. B-B3?, P-Q5!; 14. PxP, Kt-Q4)  he could have
enforced his P-K4, but in the long run White would have captured
the QRP, and remained with a passed pawn on the R file, a
powerful weapon for the end-game, e.g. l2. ... P-R6; 13. B-B1,
Kt-Q2; 14. KtxKt, BxKt; 15. P-K4, P-KB3; 16. P-B4, followed by
Kt-Kt1.

          13. RPxP          RxR
          14. RxR           B-Kt2
          15. P-KKt4

The Black pieces being cut off from the K side, White is free to
attack.

in order to prevent the release of the B by the pawn sacrifice P-
B5 and P-B4.

          23. P-R5          B-Kt2
          24. P-R6          P-Kt3

By advancing his RP White has weakened Black's KB3, with the
constant threat of establishing his Kt there and of capturing the
RP.

          25. K-B1

This move is superfluous and probably dictated by time pressure.
The proper plan is: Q-QKt2 with the threat of B-B7 or Kt8 and Q-
R8ch.

          25. ...          Q-R6
          26. Q-QKt2

The end-game is a clear win for White. He plays his Kt to KKt4,
threatening to reach B6 or K5. The effect is twofold.

Black must keep his B at K2 and his K must remain near the KBP.
White's King marches to QKt6 and captures the QB pawns, queening
his QKtP. Black cannot prevent the White King from doing this by
B-Q1, as White, by attacking Black's QB4 with his B, could at any
time force the B back to his K2. The remainder of the game needs
no comment.

             GAME No. 48

  White: Blackburne.    Black: Niemzowitsch.

           Irregular Opening.

          1. P-K3           P-Q3

It is due to this reply of Black's that the opening is irregular.
For had he played P-Q4 a peaceful QP game would have resulted, or
after White's 2. P-KB4 a Dutch opening.

          2. P-KB4          P-K4
          3. PxP            PxP

Black has the superior position; he has a pawn in the centre and
his pieces are more free.

          4. Kt-QB3         B-Q3

As was seen on a former occasion, it is a shade better to develop
the Knights before the Bishops, as the choice of moves for the
latter is less limited. The alternative might have been 5. Kt-B3,
B-KKt5; 6. B-K2, Kt-B3.

          5. P-K4

Now White has also a pawn in the centre, but he is a move behind
in his development.

          5. ...           B-K3
          6. Kt-B3         P-KB3
          7. P-Q3          Kt-K2
          8. B-K3          P-QB4
          9. Q-Q2          QKt-B3
         10. B-K2          Kt-Q5
         11. Castles KR    Castles
         12. Kt-Q1         KKt-B3
         13. P-B3

Now Black has gained an advantage from the command of his Q5. The
advance of White's QBP, which was necessitated by the dominating
position of the Black Knight, has left White with a "backward"
pawn at Q3.

         13. ...          KtxBch
         14. QxKt         R-K1

If now a general exchange takes place after P-Q4, the KP is lost
through B-Q4.

          15. Kt-R4

White's counter attack on the King's side becomes threatening,
and Black must continue his operations on the Queen's wing with
the greatest care, as he may be called upon at any time to
concentrate his pieces for the defence of the King's wing.

         15. ...           B-KB1
         16. Kt-B5         K-R1
         17. P-KKt4        Q-Q2
         18. Kt-B2         P-QR4

Black wishes to open up files on the Queen's side.

         19. P-QR3

Freeing the QR.

         19. ...            P-QKt4
         20. QR-Q1          QR-Kt1

         23. P-B4           R-R1
         24. Q-B3           R-R7

Before trying to push home his advantage on the Queen's side,
which is made possible by the weakness of White's QP, Black
should look after his King's side, where White has collected an
alarming array of forces. After the text move the Rook is quite
out of play.

          25. P-Kt5        P-Kt3?

                Diag. 167

Black should simply play PxP with the following continuation:
26. BxP, Kt-Q5; 27. KtxKt, QxKt; 28. B-K3, Q-Q3. After the move
in the text, White's attack is overwhelming.

          26. Kt-Kt4!

White obtains a Rook and two pawns for his two Knights; this is
in itself an equivalent of material. In the present instance the
exchange is of decisive advantage for White, as Black must lose
several moves to bring up his Rook for the defence of his
unguarded King.

          26. ...       PxKt
          27. KtxBP     Kt-Q5

If PxP, White wins by 28. Q-R5, Q-B2; 29. P-Kt6, QxPch; 30. QxQ
and KtxR.

          28. Q-B2      Q-B3

          32. R-K1      Q-B2
          33. Q-R4!     R-R1

Not BxP because of 34. R-KB2, followed by KR-KB sq.

          34. R-KB2     B-B3
          35. Q-Kt4

The threat is to open the Rook's file by P-Kt6 with an attack on
the King by the Rooks.

          35. ...       R-K1
          36. RxR       QxR

BxR in order to play Q-R4 might be better. With the Queens off
the board, Black has winning chances on account of his two
Bishops. But then White might evade the exchange and proceed to
seize the King's file with the Rook after 37. Q-B4.

          37. R-K2      Q-Q2
          38. R-K6      B-R1

in order to play Q-QKt2 or R2.

          39. P-Kt6!    PxP

If Q-QKt2, 40. R-K8!, if Q-R2, 40. Q-R4. White wins in either
case.

          40. RxP       Q-KR2
          41. Q-Kt3

Threatens Q-K5ch.

          41. ...       Q-R4
          42. R-Kt4!    Resigns.
